#Press Start to Play
###by a lot of people
It has been a long time since I have read a short story collection. I was even enticed to purchase this one instead of trying to find/borrow/steal a copy. This book was initially got my interest after reading *Armada* by Ernest Cline. He wrote the forward and I was like... alright maybe this will be good. 

I wasn't disappointed. One story really stood out to me and made the purchase of the book worthwhile and the other stories a bonus. Charlie Jane Anders *Rat Catcher's Yellows* was a great story about video games. But it was an even better story about dealing with mental illness. Anders is able to catch the nuances that I see everyday working in a nursing home and make the characters seem alive. 

The other story that I felt did a great job of meeting the theme in an unexpected way was *1UP* by Holly Black. The story is an amazing take on hidden abuse and finding help where you can. I thought it was a great story about escape and how video games teaching people to solve problems. 

If you are a fan of video games, fiction and sneaky feels then you will enjoy *Press Play to Start*
