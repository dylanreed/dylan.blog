<h4>Synopsis</h4>

Kyle Barnes has been plagued by demonic possession all his life and now he needs answers. Unfortunately, what he uncovers along the way could bring about the end of life on Earth as we know it. 

<h4>Review</h4>
I love Robert Kirkman. There I said it. I loved *The Astounding Wolfman* and I still love *Invincible*, even though it is ending. He is just a story teller and he creates interesting stories using settings or tropes in unexpected ways. 

When I found this at The Nerd Store I was immediately taken in by the art work. It was beautiful. The colors in this story do as much to tug at your emotions as the story. The team that put this together did a great job. 

I am glad I found this series because it might be able to replace my love of *Chew*. Maybe. Go check [Outcast](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1632150530/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dylanreed06-20) out.
