The first fight is always the hardest. My first time consisted of me flailing about and getting lucky. Apparently when you call yourself the Glass Jaw, you’re not kidding. After that I decided to learn how to be a proper hero, cape and all. Well actually not a cape. I had many nightmares about hanging myself on a fire escape to truly be comfortable wearing a cape in public. Maybe if I ever need an awesome picture I'll wear it.

Glass Jaw was an ex boxer who decided that putting on a mask and mugging women was a good way to make a quick buck. Unfortunately for him I was one of his victims. Or maybe it was lucky. He came out of the shadows of an alley wearing boxing shorts, the shiny kind, and a pair of boxing gloves. 

"I am the Glass Jaw" he said, "Give me your purse or I will give you the haymaker."

It was insane. I panicked pretty bad. I swung my bag around and hit him in the jaw. He dropped like a sack of potatoes. It was hilarious and terrifying at the same time. I may have hit him a couple times once he was down. It was a rough moment. 

After I was satisfied that he was down I called the police. They came and asked questions. The officer I spoke to didn't seem surprised to see Glass Jaw. Apparently he was a fixture in the area and had been arrested numerous times in the past. He was taken away and as far as I know is receiving help dealing with his special brand of crazy.  

For me being a hero, I still hesitate to put super in there, started without much excitement. My family wasn't rich or special. I am not an alien (I don't think so anyway). My parents were killed on the way out of a theater but I wasn't with them. I was two. I don't even remember them. Insert any sort of th orphan/raised in the system issue here. I probably have them all. But no matter what happened to me when I was younger that isn't why I became a hero. 

Some of the others I have met have awesome origin stories. I don't. I started when I was twenty-eight; twenty-eight and out of shape. I used to do gymnastics, dance and be buff. That all ended after I finished school. On my 28th birthday I noticed the existence of a gut and that I got winded going up stairs. I knew I needed to make a change. So I headed to the gym. I signed up for a year long contract and getting a free personal training session.

Personal trainers are some of the most sadistic people I have ever met. My hour long session only confirmed what I already knew, I was on my way to becoming fat and was too lazy to change anything.  I decided to do what anyone my age would do at a gym. Sit on my ass and read one of the magazines provided by the gym. Since I know that I was never going to be as in shape the people in the magazine I could at least look like I was thinking about it. 

As a force of habit I started in the back of the magazine, looking at the ads that are placed for products and services. Between ads for protein powder and vaguely legal steroids I came across an ad for Hero Courses. I pretended I didn't care about that while I carefully tore the ad out of the magazine. I took that two-inch by two-inch square and quickly left the gym and headed home. 

The ad was for a correspondence course in being a super hero. I got online and had my mind blown. There were all sorts of option and packages. After looking through all of the options I ordered the starter kit. Shipping was pretty quick and it arrived in three days. I am pretty sure I was unbearable during that time. I tracked the package on my phone, whenever I was near a computer; I even called UPS to make sure they hadn't lost it. 

The package was a simple brown box, completely nondescript. Which makes sense since you don’t want to advertise that you are becoming a superhero in case you neighbor is a villain. The box contained only five things: a book of exercises, a book about naming your hero persona, a domino mask, a pair of gloves and a catalog. 

I ignored the book of exercises because exercising is hard. Putting on the domino mask I grabbed the book: What's in a Name?  and headed to take a bath. I was in the tub until the water was cold. This book changed the way I looked at the world. Not only was it about coming up with a kick ass name, it was about the ins and outs of the hero business. I got out of the tub and into my robe and started in on the catalog

The catalog was amazing. It was where you could purchase everything you need for being a hero. It had utility belts, costumes, weapons and gadgets. You could order a starter package that included a belt, a simple costume and some investigation gear or you could order everything piece meal and get only what you need. 

Since this was going to be my new career I decided to go all out. I contacted their costume department and started work on getting my costume designed. I decided to go with purple and orange as my color scheme. It was going to take a couple of weeks to get my costume so I spent that time trying to get into shape and studying the art of being a super heroine.
