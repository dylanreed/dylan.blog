<h4>What?</h4>

The ukulele is a fantastic and amazing instrument. I imagine that the ukulele is like the evil minion of the guitar. It can do and say things that the guitar wants to, but can't. 

The ukulele is a member of the lute family and uses nylon strings. For more information about the ukulele's history try google. 


<h4>Why?</h4>

Like most people who start playing string instruments the idea was put in my head but Patrick Rothuss. The Name of the Wind guy. His descriptions of how it feels to play and perform made me thing, "Hey, I like to feel those things." So clearly I needed to learn how to play the lute. 

I wasn't able to find any lutes for sale in the Greeley area after five minutes of searching. I moved on to my second choice, which was the mandolin. Mandolins are not cheap instruments and given my propensity for giving up on things I thought it was best not to spend any money. 

Then I remembered that my mom had started learning to play the ukulele. Perfect. It was about a month ago when I had this realization and I called my mom. She still had it, and wasn't playing it. Yay for me!!

My first moment playing a ukulele was love at first strum. I loved the sound, I loved how small it was. Guitar players call it the clown of guitars, which is perfect for me. 

<h4>How?</h4> 

Playing the ukulele is pretty simple. Hold it, strum it, press the string near the frets. It is actually that simple. Playing it well is a whole other issue. 

I found a bunch of tutorials online and downloaded a tuning app. It wasn't until I found Yousician that I really started to learn. It turns out that my friend Jon (one of two) had recently picked up the ukulele as well and pointed me in that direction. 

Yousician has been great because it makes playing the ukulele into a game. Basically a perfectly designed app for my brain and it has been a lot of fun.
