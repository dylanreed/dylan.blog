#Must Write More

It is almost 2016 and that means it is time for resolutions. Normally I donâ€™t go in for that nonsense, but I thought that maybe this time will be different. You see, my problem is that I am bad at following through with goals. Once I fail to meet a goal I give up on all goals. So rather then set myself up for failure I just avoided goals. 

####This has to stop

I mean, come on Dylan. I love writing but whenever I set up a writing goal I set it to high. This makes the goal unmanageable, which then leads to failure. So how do I stop this? Break the goal into smaller pieces. Then break these into smaller pieces. Continue doing this until the journey is just a series of small steps. 

I first tried this with NaNoWriMo 2015. I wanted nothing more then to finish a novel. I had attempted in the past but the 50,000 word goal was a huge hurdle. In 2015 I broke it down further. I set at 12,500 word goal for each week which gave me two extra days. 

I then took it further and did it by day. The recommended words per day is 1,667 but since I was trying to do it in four weeks I had to write 1,785 words. I then took it one step further. I broke it down by morning and evening. I had to write 900 words in the morning and 900 in the evening. 

By breaking down my goals into such small manageable chunks I was able to reach them every day and I actually finished almost a week early.

####But what does it all mean?

It means that I found what works for me. Which is a weight off my mind. I had spent a large part of my life just embracing failure, I assumed that was just my lot in life. I would never reach my goals so I stopped reaching. 

Since I now know what I need to do to reach goals I am ready to start setting goals for 2016. The hardest thing to decide is what is actually important to me for 2016.
