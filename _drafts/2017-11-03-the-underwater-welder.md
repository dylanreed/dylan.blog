<h4>Synopsis</h4>

As an underwater welder on an oilrig off the coast of Nova Scotia, Jack Joseph is used to the immense pressures of deep-sea work -- but not the pressures of impending fatherhood. While Jack dives deeper and deeper, he seems to pull further and further away from his young wife and their unborn son. Then one night, deep in the icy solitude of the ocean floor, Jack has a mysterious and supernatural encounter that will change the course of his life forever. 

<h4>Review</h4>

I first found this book when I worked at Graphicly. It popped up on my comic book radar and I wanted to read it. But I never did. I didn't try very hard to find a copy but I did want to read it. 

Now that I have, I am sad that I waited. This book is amazing. The art is fantastic, colors are spot on, and the story. Swoon. I want to be able to write a story that is this interesting. This book tore at my heart as I read it and felt for Jack. 

Amazing book.
