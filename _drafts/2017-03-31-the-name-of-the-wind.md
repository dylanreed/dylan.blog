![The Name of the Wind](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/book-review/the-name-of-the-wind.jpg)

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

So begins the tale of Kvothe—from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe as a notorious magician, an accomplished thief, a masterful musician, and an infamous assassin. But The Name of the Wind is so much more—for the story it tells reveals the truth behind Kvothe's legend.

<h4>Review</h4>

This was a book I had every intention of reading sooner. But I never got around to it. I don't really know why but I think it had to do with not wanting to commit to another unfinished series. 

BUT OMFG THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!

I enjoyed so many small parts of this book. The descriptions of music and the way everything fits together. Even the way Rothuss handles dialect is amazing. This is moving up the list of books that love. I almost skipped ahead on the list and read the second one, but restrained myself. Now I have something to look forward too.
