<h4>Writing</h4>
I finished my first read through of *Rio Borealis*, my 2016 Nano book. It is in much better shape than I thought it would be. As I read through it I could see that I had learned a lot in my last year of writing. Granted it isn't perfect but I think I will be able to fix it up quickly. It is also less epic than *Calliope and the Living Biologic*, so there is less continuity to fix.

<h4>Life</h4>
2017 started out so well. I mean, aside from the whole Trump thing, things were looking up. My coworker was back from maternity leave and work was getting more fun. 

But then my dad got sick. An infection that spread forcing him to endure multiple surgeries and wound care. Needless to say this kicked my ass. I have been known to be emotional and when someone I love is injured or sick I do not handle it well. 

My dad getting sick got me thinking about when Sarah was sick and what a hard time I had dealing with that. It drug up a lot of emotions and stopped me from producing. I wasn't writing or sewing, just sitting around. 

<h4>Projects</h4>
The Bow Tie Project is going great. I am still enjoying making bow ties and am learning a lot about how to make them. There are so many fabrics I am looking forward to making and I can't wait to share them with you here. 

And drawing is back. I started doodling during inktober and have remembered how much I love drawing. And because I don't have enough projects going I think I will start posting more of my drawings. 

I have also started blogging a lot more. Weekly posts, bow tie project, book reviews and a monthly post. So much blogging, and now it is at dylan.blog, which is awesome.
