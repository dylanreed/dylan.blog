<h4>Writing</h4>
I finished my first read through of *Rio Borealis*, my 2016 Nano book. It is in much better shape than I thought it would be. As I read through it I could see that I had learned a lot in my last year of writing. Granted it isn't perfect but I think I will be able to fix it up quickly. It is also less epic than *Calliope and the Living Biologic*, so there is less continuity to fix.

I didn't get as many books read as previous months. At first I thought it was because my motivation to read had left me. But it turns out that life has gotten a lot more hectic and I keep adding to my hobby time. 


<h4>Life</h4>
Life still goes on and on. I am having a lot of fun, but it seems like my time is disappearing. I think being on Adderall has made me so much more focused at work that I am forced to work on all my hobbies at home. Like a normal person. 

Being on ADHD meds has really upped my productivity in some areas, but it has made other things more difficult. Writing ha become an interesting hobby because I am more likely to plan instead of just write by the seat of my pants. 

<h4>Projects</h4>
The Bow Tie Project is going great. I am still enjoying making bow ties and am learning a lot about how to make them. There are so many fabrics I am looking forward to making and I can't wait to share them with you here. 

And drawing is back. I started doodling during inktober and have remembered how much I love drawing. And because I don't have enough projects going I think I will start posting more of my drawings. 

I have also started blogging a lot more. Weekly posts, bow tie project, book reviews and a monthly post. So much blogging, and now it is at dylan.blog, which is awesome.
