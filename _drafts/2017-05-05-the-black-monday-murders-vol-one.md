<h4>Synopsis</h4>

From Jonathan Hickman (East of West, Secret Wars, Avengers) and Tomm Coker (Undying Love) comes a new crypto-noir series about the power of dirty, filthy money... and exactly what kind of people you can buy with it.

<h4>Review</h4>

This was one of the comic trade paperbacks I picked up before my colonoscopy. It grabbed it on a whim, mostly because I liked the art style, and I quite enjoyed reading through it. 

The story was interesting, though bleak. The concept of the story is interesting and I liked the way they combined historical occurrences with the events of the story.

Not sure if I would recommend this if you weren't already a fan of comics as it was more of a multimedia story, combining traditional comic formatting with prose and "found" files.
