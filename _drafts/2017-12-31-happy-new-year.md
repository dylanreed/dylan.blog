![Happy New Year!!!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/other/20172018.jpg)

So last year I set some goals. Reading goals, writing goals, bowtie goals, and blogging goals. Sadly I didn't complete any of those goals. But that is the good part about goals is that if you don't reach them... you can try again.
