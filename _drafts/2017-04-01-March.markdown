<h4>Writing</h4>
I didn't get as much writing done as I would have liked. I was distracted by the ukulele and focussing was an issue. The last part of the month was more effective once I started taking ADHD meds. 

I started editing Rio Borealis and I have learned a lot in the last year. My first draft was a lot less rough than Calliope was. I am also enjoying the story that I wrote and can't wait to share it with everyone. 

For Calliope I have found things that I want to change. I am having a huge internal debate on whether I should change things or leave them the way they are. As soon as I figure it out I will be able to move forward. 

<h4>Books</h4>


<h4>Life</h4>
Meds for Life! I started taking meds for my ADHD finally and it has been interesting. Oh I also had a colonoscopy, so that was fun. I am healthy and all that jazz. I quite drinking soda and dealt with some fun headaches around caffeine withdrawal. So that was fun. 

<h4>Projects</h4>
Bow tie project is going well.
