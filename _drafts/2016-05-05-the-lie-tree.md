I finished *The Lie Tree* yesterday and thought I should try out the whole reviewing thing. Frances Hardinge is not an author I have read previously and when I first started the book I had a hard time getting into it. 

From writing and reading about writing I know that getting the reader hooked right away is important and I didn't feel like I was hooked right away. It was only my recent decision to read different books than my norm that kept me reading. 

And I am glad that I did. 

*The Like Tree* is a fantastic book. Faith Sunderly is an awesome girl who has a fantastic way of looking at the world. All she wants is to be accepted by her family and to be allowed to do things that are normally denied to the women of the time. 

Once the story picks up, I was unable to put the book down. I was almost late for work reading the finale because I had to know. Hardinge put together a wonderful mystery with a supernatural twist.
