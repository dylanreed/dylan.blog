You may have noticed that things have changed around here. I, in my infinite wisdom, decided I need to divide things up a little bit. As I attempt to write more and possibly sell those writings I felt like I needed a place to just write whatever. So that is here. 

I moved all of my posts from dylanreed.com (I of course mean that Harper did this) and will be blogging here from now on. Dylanreed.com will become a more professional type site that will hopefully lead to people buying my books. I thought having a author like presence on the web would be good since there is an erotic fiction writer name Dylan Reed on Amazon, who is much more prolific then I.
