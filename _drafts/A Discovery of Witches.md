#A Discovery of Witches
###by Deborah Harkness
A richly inventive novel about a centuries-old vampire, a spellbound witch, and the mysterious manuscript that draws them together. <--stolen from the goodreads page. 

All of the above is true. I originally read this book because my mom wouldn't stop talking about this series of books. Which is also how I ended up reading twilight, but that is another story. 

A Discovery of Witches was a fun read, but not a reread for me. I typically judge books on how much I want to reread them. Now that the third book is out I thought about rereading the books so that I would have the story fresh in my mind when I finished the trilogy, but I can't bring myself to do it. 

I think my problem is that the characters are annoyingly connected. Like, so connected. There is no way they are not going to end up together from the first chapter. Which is fine but it is also what happens in Souless, twilight, etc. I want there to be a chance that the main character and the obvious love interest don't have an immediate connection. 

What I really enjoyed about this book was the world that the author created. Her take on Vampires, etc. felt fresh to me. Which when you are repurposing monsters as good guys is very important.

This whole series was a fun read, but I won't be rereading it anytime soon. Sorry mom.
