Falling ten stories takes longer than you think. I had plenty of time to think as a fell. I noticed that it had started to rain. I wondered who would feed my cat. I noticed how the strap of my bag dug into my shoulder. The strap. Oh Cora you are such an idiot. I quickly took my bag off my shoulder and swung it at the retreating rail of the fire escape. It caught and promptly slammed me into the wall of the building. Which in the grand scheme of things is better then slamming into the ground. 

I scrambled over to the fire escape, ignoring my injuries. Blood streamed down my face as I clamored over the rail and pushed myself against the wall. I looked up and froze. There was a man looking out the window I had just leapt through. He wasn’t looking straight down which was the only reason he hadn’t spotted me. I quietly untangled the shoulder strap of my bag, made sure I still had Bessie and slunk down the fire escape. I heard no cries that I had been seen and crept home to nurse my wounds. Hopefully the picture I took would help me find out what the hell is going on. 
 
Home is a shitty basement apartment. It is in a house near the college so my upstairs roommates change every year. I like to think that this helps keep my identity secret since I don’t really get to know my roommates. You enter right into my living room after going down a flight of stairs. The light sucks down here but as far as caves go it is pretty sweet. One of the walls is even made out of stacked stone, which adds to the ambiance.
 
My living room consists of a really nice thrift store couch. It is super comfortable. And only smells like pee a little bit which makes it special. My kitchen is small and barely functions. But I can nuke a burrito as well as anyone so it works for me.
 
My bedroom is through the only other door in the living room. It has a mattress, not from a thrift store because, you know, bed bugs. Also since I am bad a laundry I also have piles of laundry in my room all the time.
 
What makes this apartment special is that there is an extra room. It is all concrete; floors and walls. I added the soundproofing to the ceiling and it is my secret base. I have done everything I can to hide it. I even put bookshelves and a bookcase door to hide the entrance. I call it the Alcove.
 
Inside I have a computer, a couple of screens and a pile of catalogs for super-stuff. I spend most of my time in the Alcove. I have a fancy case for holding my suit. After a week of heroing I realized that super suits smell bad after just a day of use. Sure most of the suit is a rubber-kevlar blend that is easy to clean but it still holds sweat.
 
This fancy case for holding my suit is a commercial sanatizer like what they use in restaurants to sanitize dishes. I peel out of my suit and toss it in and push go. I slip into my research clothes or what most people call a robe and sit at my computer to do some research.
 
None of the books tell you that most of the work for being a hero is really mind-numbingly boring. I like internet research as much as the next person but honestly searching for weird high-tech dog collars on line is just going to lead down a path of the internet that you don’t want to go.
 
I came up with nothing on my search. If only I had been able to get my hands on the device and bring it home with me. Then I could have fiddled with it and maybe figured something out.  More likely I would have shocked myself.
