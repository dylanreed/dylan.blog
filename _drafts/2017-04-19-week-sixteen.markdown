This was the week that I discovered Minecraft... again. Thanks Harper. Since Minecraft is just legos for adults it is really easy to lose and hour or six in. This isn't my first time experiencing this phenomenon, but I am having a hard time pulling myself away from it this time. 

So instead of stopping I am making myself use it as a reward. If I get all of my writing, ukulele and other projects done I can work on my buildings. Right now I am making a western town in a mesa and putting some finishing touches on an underwater town. 

The book I am currently reading is super enjoyable so I am taking my time and savoring the circus ness of it. Oh, it is *The Night Circus*, and it is everything I wanted in a book about a circus. 

Everyone have a great week.
