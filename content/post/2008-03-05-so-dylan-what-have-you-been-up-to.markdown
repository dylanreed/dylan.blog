First off, thanks for asking. I have been up to quite a bit lately. As I mentioned in a very short previous post my tooth, ass and life where making me mad for very different reasons. Since writing that post I have been able to figure out each one and everything is going better. 

For my tooth, I had it pulled. It was one of my wisdom teeth that just wouldn't stop hurting. The tooth was huge. When they pulled it out and showed it to me I couldn't believe how big it was. It was about the size of the tip of my thumb. Yeah that big. Unfortunately do to some craziness about bio-hazards and what not I was unable to take it home with me and make a necklace or paper weight out of it. 

Since my tooth was bothering me and I pulled it, I am pretty sure that is what my ass was afraid of. I had to go in and get a scope done to check for bad things and luckily there was nothing up there. Let me just tell everyone that may care that getting a scope isn't really a super fun time. The stuff you have to drink for the prep will make you want to die. Imagine drinking a floor cleaner with a nice lime zest flavor. It rocks.

As far as life goes, it is getting better. My dad is sick but getting better and we finally had a little talk about how I want to go back to school and don't really want to take over the family business. Part of this is because stress breaks my ass and partly because I would rather be poor and happy then rich and grumpy all the time.
