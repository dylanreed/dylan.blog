Sarah and I have decided that, like many Americans, we need more money. Alas opportunities for extra money are not as readily available as you might think. Crazy right. We started looking at home businesses that would allow us to do something we are good at while making us money. We settled on Pampered Chef. We choose Pampered chef primarily because we love their products, which makes selling a lot easier, plus we like to cook so it should be pretty fun to sell as well. This is our first experiment into the world of Multi level marketing which I have heard good and bad things about. The bad things seem to be based around the promise of riches with not a lot of work. Luckily Sarah and I understand that we will have to work hard to make this work. Be prepared to be contacted about buying Pampered Chef stuff, because it is on.
