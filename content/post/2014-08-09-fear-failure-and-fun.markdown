I wrote a [book][1].

It started out as a blog post. 1000 words about dealing with fear and failure using fun. I shared it with Harper and he encouraged me to write an e-book. So I did.

Since I have a full time job I wrote a lot of the book in short spurts. When I was on a computer I used [draft][2]. Draft is a great online word processor made only for writing. It is fantastic. I recommend it to anyone who needs an online writing solution.

Unfortunately I don't spend that much time in front of a computer. I spend most of my time in a car waiting for people to show up for appointments. I needed a way to write in my car. A laptop would have been ideal. I have a mac mini at home and that is not super portable. Sarah has a laptop but I didn't want to steal it from her.

I do have an iPad though. After much researching I found a nice keyboard that converts the iPad into a basic laptop. I wrote 3/4 of this book on that. I was quite happy with the way it all worked together. I would write in pages on the ipad, save to iCloud and then copy paste into Draft. That allowed me to use Drafts built in editors to help me write better.

The other tool I found useful was [Hemingway][3]. This app is great because it helps you simplify your writing in a non-destructive way. It highlights sections that are troublesome and then unhighlights them once you fix them. Really helps getting rid of passive voice in writing.

With all of these tools I was able to get the book finished. Harper helped me with getting it all set up with Amazon. It has been live for just over a month. Feel free to check it out: [The Three Fs: Using fun to overcome fear and failure][4].
