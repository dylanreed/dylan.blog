_Paid Post_  
[BarterBee.com - The Free Way to Get Movies, Music, and Games][1] is basically a barter site. You take your old movies, video games and CDs convert them into points which you can then use to purchase other peoples stuff.

They provide you with mailers, which then provides you with a bit of insurance on the mailing. Also since it isn't for cash it is more of a trade, I feel more comfortable not having to use a ATM\credit card to purchase or receive things online.

Also I think that did a god job of not focusing so tightly on one media type but also not going to broad with the products offered for barter. I think that this is a great step in the direction of a nice bartering site. I hope that this site becomes bigger and starts a movement like ebay or amazon.

I am going to be purusing this site and as Sarah and I come across more DVDs that we are going to get rid of I am going to start using this site a lot more. Give it a try and you may be suprised at the number of good finds on this site.

Plus the log is awesome.
