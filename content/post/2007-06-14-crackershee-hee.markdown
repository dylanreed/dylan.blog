[Harper][1] just posted about how some crackers called him to try to try and get into his server and do **__VERY BAD THINGS__** to or with his server. Upon reading the title of his post here is went through my mind:

> Crackers = White people
> 
> Using a racial term doesn't seem very Harper, especially since he himself is white.
> 
> WTF, Harper hates white people
> 
> WTF why are white people specifically trying to trick Harper

  
After all of that I figured out what he meant by [crackers][2].
