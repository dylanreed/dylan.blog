First Batik tie. Look how pretty it is!! When sewing it the fabric was so stiff that I almost didn't add interfacing. But luckily I did. Apparently when batik fabrics are washed for the first time it washing away the last of the wax left over from the dying process and softens the fabric. So I dodged a bullet there.


<h3>How can you help?</h3>

Do you also love bow ties? No one needs 52 bow ties, so I was thinking I could share the making of them with others. If you want a bow tie, you just need to buy the fabric, pay for shipping,  and I will add you to the list. Shoot me an email so we can set it up. I will need to know what size your neck is. 

Since I also want to gain some bow ties from this experience I will be only opening up twenty-six of the fifty-two ties for people. So get in now or miss out. Fill out the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3)

Wish me luck and check back every week for the newest bowtie.
