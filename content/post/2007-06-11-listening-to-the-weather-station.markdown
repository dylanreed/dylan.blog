Sunday Sarah and I went over to my parents house to help put together my dad's new fancy weather station. It was a pretty fun time of doing manly things and it went up pretty fast.

The funniest thing about putting it up was that we put everything together, drilled holes and ran all the wires; then we read the instructions and found out that we needed to move the transmitter from being in the hot sun to being in the shade.

I will say that typically when my family embarks on a project, planning is kept to a minimum and results to a maximum. Basically we don't read instructions. Ever.

Apparently the weather station is working, though I haven't checked in with the parents today to make sure.
