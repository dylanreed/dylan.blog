Which I think i spelled wrong but what ever.

I was traveling to Brighton Colorado the other day with Sarah when I saw an interesting group of signs. It was a set of for signs, all of them blue in color with white\silver markings. One said Police Station, one said, Hospital, One said Town Hall and the last one was a siloette of someone reading a book. Wouldn't you think that that one should be words and the rest pictures. I think that most people that would be looking for a library might be able to read and might not need the picture but thats just me.

Thats all.

Why do i sign my post no one knows its not a letter, or is it?
