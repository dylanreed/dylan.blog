Bow Ties are Awesome!!

That is all you need to know.

Sewing bow ties has become easier as the weeks have progressed, and I am finding little tricks on making them look better when finished. 

Also, I may have purchased too much Valentines day fabric, so we may have a couple weeks of heart bow ties. This is the first and is my favorite of the v-day fabrics. 

I like the subtle lacy hearts and the nice neutral color. This is a heart bow tie that you can wear year round. Of course whether I should wear something or not has never stopped me before. 

<h3>How can you help?</h3>

Do you also love bow ties? No one needs 52 bow ties, so I was thinking I could share the making of them with others. If you want a bow tie, you just need to buy the fabric, pay for shipping,  and I will add you to the list. Shoot me an email so we can set it up. I will need to know what size your neck is. 

Since I also want to gain some bow ties from this experience I will be only opening up twenty-six of the fifty-two ties for people. So get in now or miss out. Fill out the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3)

Wish me luck and check back every week for the newest bowtie.
