So I spent a little time today updating [Sarah's blog][1] with a new theme with sidebars and am trying to get Sarah to use categories. After a bad start with a theme that was messy and as my [brother][2] put it: "MY EYES", I was off to a much better start. I made the header using a picture of a road and a picture of Reno that I had removed the background from, I also modified the CSS of the theme to fit my needs a little better.

I then set up the ads and the sidebar as well as some categories, now I just need to get Sarah to update a lot. We shall see. Oh I also took this sweet picture:

It is a picture of a hearse with BTK on the back. I love serial killer fans.
