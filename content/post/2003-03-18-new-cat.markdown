Hell all Sarah and I got a kitty together. His name is Thomas O. Malley (the Ally cat). He is helping me type this so sorry about any random letters. i will try to scan in a picture as well for all you kitty fans. He is black and white and is a love. He is all about kitty kissees and after only 2 accidents is sucessfully potty trained he is a talker and meows all the time not just whining but just talking away he ++++++++ loves to be close to people and is just learnng that he can jump. here is the picture more to come
