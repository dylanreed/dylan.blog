This is the recipe Sarah and I use when Making our delicious Potato Soup:  
Supplies:

  * 3-5 Medium Red Potatos
  * 1 cup reserved cooking liquid
  * 1 Small Onion
  * 3 Tbsp Butter
  * 3 Tbsp Flour
  * Crushed Red Pepper Flakes
  * Ground Black Pepper
  * 1\2 tsp Sugar
  * 1 1\2 cup Milk
  * 1 cup Cheese
  


  
Peel Potatos and cut into 1 inch cubes. Place in large sauce pan, fill pot one inch above the top of the potatos. Bring to a boil, turn burner to low, cover and let stand for 30 minutes. Drain potatos over a measuring cup to reserve 1 cup of cooking liquid. Set aside cooking liquid and potatos. Peel and finely chop onion. Melt butter in pot over a medim heat, add onion, stirring until translucent and tender, but not brown. Add flour and season with red and black pepper-cook 3-4 minutes. Add potatos, reserved liquid, milk and sugar. Once mixed stir in the cheese. Simmer over low for 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Eat and enjoy.
