So this week is my spring break from work. It is Sarah's Spring Break so I took it off as well. It has be crazy so far with Sarah and I painting our study brown, really really brown. It looks awesome and makes for a cozy reading room\study\office\whatever I want it to be.

I think that soon Sarah is going to get her clown on. Pics to come. All i need to do is build her a costume.
