So this last week was crazy. I did some balloon work for a cult. The cult was the [Red HAt Society][1], which consists mostly of ladies over 50, if you happen to be under 50 you are instead a Pink Hat. I enjoyed it quite a bit and thank them for their genorosity and also would like to thank my mom for joining the aforementioned cult and hooking me up with the work.

I would say that as far as cults go this one is fairly layed back and is really more of a gang since religious beliefs didn't seem to be a big part of the proceedings. So all you other hat societys watch out cause the red hats are gonna get you.

Oh and none of them really knew anything about Linux.. weird
