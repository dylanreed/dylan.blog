I was at my parentÃ¢a‚¬a„¢s house the other day when I stumbled across one of my favorite series of fantasy books. It is the [Belgariad][1] by David and Leigh Eddings. These are books that I borrowed from a friend in about 6th or 7th grade and had a hard time getting into. Then He moved away and I never got him his books back (because I am a bad friend). I finally read them in 8th grade and found them to be quite good.

I decided to reread them. Unfortunately since it is a five book series that involved a lot of hunting in my parentÃ¢a‚¬a„¢s house and I could only find 2 of the 5. So I instead went and bought the complete collection that is included in two volumes.

These books start out following the formula the Joseph Campbell talks about in the Power of Myth. Basically there is the main Character, Garion, who has a call to power which he refuses and then accepts to complete the goal of defeating the evil.

The books are not the simple but you get the idea. Along the way he encounters all sorts of well developed and colorful characters that you will defiantly enjoy. My favorite is Silk, mostly because he is closest to the thief\assassin characters that I love in all of the fantasy books I read.

I would recommend this series to anyone who likes fantasy; it has all of the important parts of a good fantasy novel, including court intrigue and evil sorcerers
