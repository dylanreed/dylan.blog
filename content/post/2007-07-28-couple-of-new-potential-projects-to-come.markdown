First: Learn some new tricks. I am looking at learning some new magic tricks as well as perfect some of the ones I have had for a while. I am talking to you torn.  
  
Second: Start planning a school assemby show. This is something I have wanted to do for a while and it will be a great thing to work on for the next year since it doesn't cost anything to plan a show. Possible themes are: history of clowning, history of juggling, or maybe just something entertaining about if at first you don't succeed try try again. We shall see.

Third: Buy Super Mario Galaxy and beat it, enjoy it and trick Sarah into enjoying it as well.

Fourth: Design a Wordpress for this sight so I can stop using other people stuff so much.  
  
Fifth: Redesign Clownsareawesome.com so it is truly awesome. Add Pics, Videos and more information in general.

Sixth: Continue to be awesome.
