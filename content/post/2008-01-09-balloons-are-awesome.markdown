I recently got asked to start making balloon animals at the local TGI Fridays on Saturday evenings. This means that I will start obsessing over balloons again. Which is good because they are awesome. They have changed a lot since I first started. Electric pumps are now super expensive and fancy, there is a whole company dedicated to aprons and the like and there are twice as many colors offered by the company I use for balloons as well as three other companies. Here is a video about balloon dogs, it is a little sad but is quite enjoyable. So enjoy.
