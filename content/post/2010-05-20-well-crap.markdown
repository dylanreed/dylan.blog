This morning, May 20th, I made Sarah and I homemade donuts with her donut pan she got for her birthday. We enjoyed them quite a bit and I shared one with my mom and one with my friend Jon. I forgot to take one over to my mother in law like I was supposed to. Luckily we had two left over that I ran over tonight with this card attached. Feel free to use it whenever you forget to give someone homemade donuts. [![][1]][2]For those of you that are wondering they where delicious and they were cinnamon/sugar cake donuts. Sarah also got a mini donut pan which we will try out next.
