Hi everyone,

Its me. Thank you very much for all you comments. I am very happy. Hope everyone is doing fine. School is good, it is boring but very fun. Yesterday I got to go inside a hyperbaric chamber and be pressurized down to 40 feet of sea water. While there I got to spend 20 minutes on 100% oxygen. It was pretty cool. I am very very very happy right now. I am engaged to the most beutiful person in the world and I love it. Sarah is the love of my life. I wish that I could see her every day but alas not for another 10 months. I am going home to visit in April which is cool. I am on the Deans list still which is cool. I hope to stay on it all through school. Alright thats enough. Everyone have a nice day.

Dylan
