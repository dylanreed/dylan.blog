The channel crossing happend on last sat. it kick major....well nevermind. it was a lot of fun. i was on a boat the size of my moms mountaneer with my car parked in front for length and about twice as wide for about 13+ hrs. it was quite a bit of fun. We did it we broke the world record of a dive pull sled in cold water continously of 52 miles. the dive pull record is actually 62 miles but that was done scubado with lots of breaks in the caribian... wimp. anyway a week from this saturday i should be doing my juggling it will be fun. love all but especieally sarah. what happend to the vault girls??
