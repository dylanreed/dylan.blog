For some reason over the past four months, possibly longer, I have had little or no desire to blog. Nothing personal against you guys, it is just that I have been trying to find my stride at school. It was going well until I was hit with the H1N1 or as I like to call it the Swine Death Plague. That knocked me out for a little over a week and I have been playing catch-up ever since. Luckily CSU has been cool with the whole pandemic business and I didn't fall that far behind. I am finishing playing catch-up today and I figured I could up date my blog and get back in the swing of writing. For your viewing pleasure, here is what I have been up to:

That slideshow is all of the sculptures I have produced thus far, in reverse order. It should go clown, donut, chair, but flickr dosen't display it that way. I have had a good time in sculpture class and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. Drawing one on the other had has been a great experience though I learned that I am not great at drawing.  My fiction class was boring at first but now that we are reading One Hundred Years of Solitude it has become quite a bit of fun. Biology is super boring, I want to sleep when I am in that class. Seriously. Boring.

Sarah is good, though right now she has the bronchitis and wishes that would stop. The cats are good and pesty. In fact everything seems to be going good.
