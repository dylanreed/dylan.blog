This was an exciting week. Or so it seems. 

I went to the doctor. Not because I was sick, but for a check up. That was actually just today. It was awesome because it was free!! Thanks insurance. Sure hope nothing is happening with insurance because it would suck if someone was fucking with it. 

I have an official diagnosis for ADHD now. Which was surprising to no-one who has spent anytime with me. I have been given adderall to try and see how it helps with my symptoms. SO... if I seem less scattered maybe that is a good thing. Hopefully it doesn't bring out an underlying psychosis. Fingers crossed.

Also, we have been watching Buffy, and if you haven't stop reading now. We just got to the episode where Buffy's mom dies. AND WHAT THE FUCK!! I am not prepared to deal with this kind of shit. I don't want to cry into my hot dog and french fries but I will. 

I do not know if I am emotionally equipped for this right now, but luckily we are also watching Angel and he will most likely get to punch people.
