I finally finished building a foam puppet... It only took  me a couple years to get it done. Now I want to build another one with what I learned from this one. It is quite a bit of fun and not that difficult if you aren't afraid to do a little experimenting.

Things I would change:

  * Make him bigger. My hand/arm barely fit.
  * Do something different with the eyes. Like sink them into the skull a little bit. Also better pupils
  * I had a really hard time with the mouth. But I figured out the best way to do it... I think
  * Add a tongue. All that red is crazy.
  * Arm rods
  * Hand sew the whole thing, because I am just that hardcore.
  * Try and get away from the knock off muppet look.
  


  
I'll try again soon. May need to get some more foam. I was mostly just winging it this time and so I used stuff I had lying around. I want to do a little more planning next time and build an awesome puppet.
