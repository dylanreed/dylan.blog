Now that I have your attention here is how school is going. I finished up the last class with an 'A' and have started the Practical Applications clas. 

This class is interesting though somewhat annoying. Since it is all real world senerios that a lot of people in my class can't grasp the ideas and fight them tooth and nail.

In fact, right at this moment in class I want a rabbit to come a long and punch me in the nose
