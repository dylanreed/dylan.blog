With all of two votes, one of them mine, I have called the voting. The winner is... THE BLUE CINCTOPUS. Not one of the initial options there was a huge write in campaign that led to his victory. Let's go down to the winner for his victory speech.

> " I would like to thank my campaign team, Bob, Stephan and Lucy, as well as my beautiful wife, the wonderful and charming yellow cinctopus. To my daughters, yes we are getting a dog. Thank you all for your support"

Wow that was amazing. Congratulations Mr. Viddler Player Branding 2009. This is so exciting.
