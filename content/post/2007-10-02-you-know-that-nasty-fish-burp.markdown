So I started taking Omega Three Fatty Acids in an attempt to fight the ADHD. So far it seems to be working, I am still a little bit distracted all day but am better able to focus on tasks long term. Of course this is only day two.

The pills I am taking are a gel type capsule and I think they are full of fish oil because I get nasty post overeating sushi burps about an hour after taking them. So if you are going to take pills of liquid fish just keep that in mind.
