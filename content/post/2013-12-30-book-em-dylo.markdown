I have been stuck in a little bit of a reading rut. I read the same books over and over again. On the plus side I really enjoy the books I read, on the minus side is the fact that I rarely experience the joy of surprise that comes from reading a new book.

In high school my future brother-in-law went to all the teachers he respected and asked them for a list of books that he should read. I don't remember how long it was but he committed himself to making his way through it. Seems like a pretty fantastic plan.

I have set up a form via google for people to submit books to. It is [here][1]. Please take the time to suggest one or more books. I will also make the [list][2] view able so that you can check if the book you are suggesting is one that has been suggested.

Please suggest books. I will be compiling a list by the first-ish of the year and try to read as many books as possible in 2014. I have to finish reading the Harry Potter series for the thousandth time first so you have books 4, 5,6 and 7 to suggest books. After I get some books I am going to try to create a random chooser to help me make the list.

Thanks
