I am quite sorry that I have been doing paid posts so much recently. Basically I am a greedy little bastard and want to make lots of money on my blog. I am making sure to put _Paid Post _right after the title.

I will also try not to group them as tightly together, maybe one or two a week at most. Or one per five regular posts. We'll see.
