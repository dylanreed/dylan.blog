So I own both the [Wii][1] and the [Xbox 360][2] and I find them both to be quite enjoyable, though I play the 360 more. This is because I am a lazy gamer. Even though I find the wii more enjoyable to play I find that I would rather sit on the couch and relax then move a lot when I play.

I also tend to be playing games while I am making dinner. My [Xbox 360][3] has better range on the controller since it is not based on my position to the tv. I got to thinking about this when I realized that I was playing my older Xbox games instead of finishing [Zelda][4] or [Trauma Center][5]. It has nothing to do with the quality of games, there has just not been a game I have played on the Wii that is a great screw around game. Whereas [Saints Row][6] and [Oblivion][7] are great screw around games when you have a short time to play.

I am thinking that this will change once I start to get more [Wii][8] games from [Game Fly.][9]
