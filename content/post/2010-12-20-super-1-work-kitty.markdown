As you might have noticed on my flickr feed I have been doing a lot of marker drawings. I made one yesterday that I think must be a representation of what I am right now. As I stated in an [earlier pos][3]t I have taken a leave of abscence from school to make the money and pay off the debt. So I have become Super #1 Work Kitty. While this picture does not actually show what I wear everyday to work at OfficeMax it represents the difference in what I was wearing to art school versus what I am wearing now as an hourly employee.

I am enjoying my job. It allows me to talk to people and that is what I thrive on. I am also enjoying having free time to pursue projects that I enjoy. I hope to post a lot of my art work here and everything I produce over the next year is for sale. seriously... I will sell it to you. I will have art prints availible of everything until the original sales... then it is over. I will also limit the number of prints to 50 so get them while they are hot. Oh and the store will be [here][4]. There is still a lot of work to do before the launch but look for it around the first of 2011.
