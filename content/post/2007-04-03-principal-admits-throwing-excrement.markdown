[WTF.][1] So I thought the second one of my first post of the day was bad. I mean exposing yourself over the Internet and getting a way with is pretty bad. However this one is much funnier and also much more of a WTF. So you got mad at a kid, don't throw poop, that is just bad form.

I am still laughing.
