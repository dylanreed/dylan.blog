<h4>Synopsis</h4>

On a remote, icy planet, the soldier known as Breq is drawing closer to completing her quest. Once, she was the Justice of Toren - a colossal starship with an artificial intelligence linking thousands of soldiers in the service of the Radch, the empire that conquered the galaxy. Now, an act of treachery has ripped it all away, leaving her with one fragile human body, unanswered questions, and a burning desire for vengeance.

<h4>Review</h4>
This is the kind of science fiction I like. It was about the characters and the world they are in. Parts of it reminded me of [The Goblin Emperor](http://dylan.blog/2017/03/17/the-goblin-emperor) as it was about protocol and other parts reminded me of classic space opera. 

The idea of Ancillaries was terrifying and interesting. It almost felt like a story written from the perspective of the Tines from [The Children of the Sky](http://dylan.blog/2017/04/21/the-children-of-the-sky). Again a fantastic use of differing views from character and I was amazed at how well it was executed. 

Great book, and yet another first book in a series. I need to stop doing that. *sigh*
