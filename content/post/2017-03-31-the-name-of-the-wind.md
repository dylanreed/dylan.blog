<h4>Synopsis</h4>

So begins the tale of Kvothe—from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe as a notorious magician, an accomplished thief, a masterful musician, and an infamous assassin. But The Name of the Wind is so much more—for the story it tells reveals the truth behind Kvothe's legend.

<h4>Review</h4>

This was a book I had every intention of reading sooner. But I never got around to it. I don't really know why but I think it had to do with not wanting to commit to another unfinished series. 

BUT OMFG THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!

I enjoyed so many small parts of this book. The descriptions of music and the way everything fits together. Even the way Rothuss handles dialect is amazing. 

[The Name of the Wind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0756404746/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dylanreed06-20) deserves all of the praise it has received. This is how fantasy should be written, with a level of craftsmanship that is unmatched in modern fantasy. 

This is moving up the list of books that I love. I almost skipped ahead on the list and read the second one, but restrained myself. Now I have something to look forward too.
