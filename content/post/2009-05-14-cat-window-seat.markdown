  content: "Awesome.\r\nMy name is Cameron. I was the one that suggested the link
    for the Kitty Cot to Make. \r\n\r\nI thought I would just say that you did an
    awesome job. How much did it end up costing you to make in the end?  I am glad
    someone re-made the product ($50 buck seems a bit steep for my tastes). I need
    to get around to make one for my cat."

Made in one afternoon. PVC, Fabric, twine(which may be switched to wire), suction cups and a curious fat cat. He weighs in around 16 lbs and is good to go.

Things to change:

  * Stronger fabric that has a little less give
  * Metal wire instead of twine
