<h4>Writing</h4>

I didn't get as much writing done as I would have liked. I was distracted by the ukulele, and focussing was an issue. The last part of the month was more effective once I started taking ADHD meds. 

I started editing Rio Borealis and I have learned a lot in the last year. My first draft was a lot less rough than Calliope was. I am also enjoying the story that I wrote and can't wait to share it with everyone. 

For Calliope I have found things that I want to change. I am having a huge internal debate on whether I should change things or leave them the way they are. As soon as I figure it out I will be able to move forward.

This months books were had a few more graphic novels than usual. This is mostly because of my super fun colonoscopy prep. All of them were awesome. My favorite book of April was [The Girl who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of her own Making](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250010195/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dylanreed06-20)


<h4>Life</h4>
Meds for Life! I started taking meds for my ADHD finally and it has been interesting. Oh I also had a colonoscopy, so that was fun. I am healthy and all that jazz. I quite drinking soda and dealt with some fun headaches around caffeine withdrawal. So that was fun. 

I am finding ADHD meds to be very helpful in dealing with my symptoms and I am finding being able to focus on a plan long term to be quite nice. 

<h4>Projects</h4>
Bow tie project is going well. I am getting ready to start making ties for others, so if you are interested fill out the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3)
