It has been a crazy couple of weeks, and by a couple of weeks I mean a month and a half. This summer, if you can call it that, has been full of ups, downs and a bunch of family crap. My father decided to get sick, and not just the usual sick but crazy sick. He was out of work for about 6 weeks two of which where spent in the hospital. During that time I was on work duty/on-call at the hospital duty and I don't really feel as if I have recovered from it yet. 

Also there has been a few changes at work so that the boss has to work less, this is secretly or not so secretly leading me to have more work to do. Which is fine. I am enjoying the new aspects of my job, since my dad has ackknowledged that I am good with people, so allowing me to deal with people on a regular basis is a good thing. I am now realizing how annoying all of our customers are and how much I want a stick to  hit said customers with. If you happen to be a past customer of ours or a current customer I am not talking about you I am talking about everyone else. 

Well that is all for now. I am back on the blogging band wagon, I hope to update again in the next week or so. We shall see.
