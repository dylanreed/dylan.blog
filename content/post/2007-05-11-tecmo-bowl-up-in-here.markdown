I just found out that they are making a new [Tecmo Bowl][1]. I hope I am not the only one who enjoyed the original NES Tecmo Bowl. Hopefully this game is just what its predecessor was. An easy to play, easy to enjoy game for anyone. I also hope that the diagonal running trick that I vaguely remember works on the new as it did on the old.
