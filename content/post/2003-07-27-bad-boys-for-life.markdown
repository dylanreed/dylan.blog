I saw Bad Boys II today. It was pretty good, not as good as legally blonde II, but good. Lots of explosions and a few good car chases. lots of gross morgue humor so thats good. I had fun on saturday at the arts picnic. I dressed up as a clown and ran a muck. a muck a muck a muck thats how i ran. i did probably three 30 min shows and did some crazy unicycling. I am so sleepy.
