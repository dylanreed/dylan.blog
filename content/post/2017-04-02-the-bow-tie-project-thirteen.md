Check out my new model. Only a close up for now, but Ramona is the best bow tie model in the world. This red gingham fabric is one that caught my eye right away. It is a fun tie and works great as a diamond point tie. 

The great thing about the red is that it goes with everything. Well maybe not for everyone... but for me it goes with everything. This tie reminds me of spring and picnics and all of that good stuff. 

<h3>How can you help?</h3>

Do you also love bow ties? No one needs 52 bow ties, so I was thinking I could share the making of them with others. If you want a bow tie, you just need to buy the fabric, pay for shipping,  and I will add you to the list. Shoot me an email so we can set it up. I will need to know what size your neck is. 

Since I also want to gain some bow ties from this experience I will be only opening up twenty-six of the fifty-two ties for people. So get in now or miss out. Fill out the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3)

Wish me luck and check back every week for the newest bowtie.
