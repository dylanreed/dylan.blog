Buy 1 pkg hot roll mix

buy small package of mozerella cheese ( not shredded because it has wood chips in it)

buy pizza sauce or pasta sauce

buy toppings (sausage, green peppers, mushrooms)

Prep dough according to package instructions for pizza

while dough is rising pre heat oven

After Dough Rises place sauce then cheese then toppings then more cheese

place pizza in oven for about 15 minutes maybe 20
