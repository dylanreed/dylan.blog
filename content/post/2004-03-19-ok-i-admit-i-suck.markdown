   No its true i do. I really suck down the pepsi. I'm not kidding. Another thing I suck at is updating my page. I did however find the [perfect car for harper][1] I mean its perfect.  
Work is good. I enjoy it lots. lots and lots. more then sleeping. well maybe not. I do however like reading [dan brown][2] he rules. I would suggest digital fortress, then deception point and then angels and demons, and lastly davinci code
