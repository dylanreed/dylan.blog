![][1]  When I was a little person I played little league baseball and I always enjoyed it. Well  of it except batting, because having someone hurl a hardball at you is really really scary.

After I quit playing ball to focus on being awesome I discovered baseball video games and really enjoyed them, especially the early ones that where as in-depth as you wanted them to be and where easy to understand. Some of my favorite parts of those early games, whose names escape me right now, was the ability to manage the games and not having to play an entire seasons worth of games.

![][2] That brings me to the subject of today's post. MLB Power Pros for the Wii. This is an Americanized version of a Japanese baseball game that has been around forever. It is very cartoon in look and unlike most of its peers it has a really simple control scheme. Power Pros is set up to give anyone playing a chance at winning by varying the level of computer help. Pros also has a very in depth season mode where you manage a team for 10 years, drafting, trading and generally (in my case) running the team into the ground.

There is also a mode of the game that has a semi role playing feel to it. This mode, called Success, is a great way to waste a lot of time as you take your created character from a lowly college ball player all the way into the minor leagues. From there you are able to draft him onto your team and use him in play on your team (which I am running into the ground, God I hope Golly G. Willikers can save us). 

Other modes, which I haven't played are home run derby, exhibition and a couple others I don't remember. All in all it has been a really fun game for the two hours I have played it and I will probably have to convert it from a rental to a owned game. The only sad thing is no online play, which for me is good since I would just get owned online as I do offline, but it is an awesome game. So wish me luck in the season, I play the Detroit Tigers tonight with my expansion team the Alaskan Orcas. GO WHALES!!!!!
