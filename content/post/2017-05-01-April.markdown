<h4>Writing</h4>
I finished my first read through of *Rio Borealis*, my 2016 Nano book. It is in much better shape than I thought it would be. As I read through it I could see that I had learned a lot in my last year of writing. Granted it isn't perfect but I think I will be able to fix it up quickly. It is also less epic than *Calliope and the Living Biologic*, so there is less continuity to fix.

I didn't get as many books read as previous months. At first I thought it was because my motivation to read had left me. But it turns out that life has gotten a lot more hectic and I keep adding to my hobby time. 


<h4>Life</h4>
Life still goes on and on. I am having a lot of fun, but it seems like my time is disappearing. I think being on Adderall has made me so much more focused at work that I am forced to work on all my hobbies at home. Like a normal person. 

Being on ADHD meds has really upped my productivity in some areas, but it has made other things more difficult. Writing ha become an interesting hobby because I am more likely to plan instead of just write by the seat of my pants. I am still learning the best way to do that. 

<h4>Projects</h4>
The Bow Tie Project was going great, but this last week I just didn't have time. I mean... I had time, I just did other things instead. This week I will get back on my game and get a tie made. 

My brother in law got me Warhammer: Age of Sigmar for my birthday. It is a problem because Warhammer is one of those games I am fascinated with. Previously I had worked on a Skaven army but assembling them was a pain in the ass. They were on square bases and you had to make sure they could stand together as a unit. 

Age of Sigmar seems to be a little easier to assemble and I like that you can now play any combination of army within the different factions. So a dwarf, elf, lizard people army is now a thing.
