So today I saw this on my twitter:

  


> _nata2: fixing dylans blog... i mean.. "upgrading"_

So I sent Harper a nice little message to find out how he was screwing up my stuff. Right after I asked I had to go to a meeting so I kind of left him hanging. Here is the chat:

  


> _me: what are you doing to my blog_
> 
> _Harper: fixing it ;)_
> 
> _3:46 PM i helped my buddy scott with his blog_
> 
> _and in the process found some cool plugins_
> 
> _so i added them to your blog_
> 
> _me: oh i see_
> 
> _Harper: you were not around_

> _3:47 PM and i deleted all your themes_
> 
> _cuz there were too many_
> 
> _i hope you are not mad_
>

I love Harper because his rambling apology\wish I wouldn't have made me laugh.
