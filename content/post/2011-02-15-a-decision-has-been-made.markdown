Last night, well actually all day yesterday, was my 30th birthday. The day that I said I had to decide what book I was going to use in my drawing studies first. And BAM! a decision has been made. I will be using this book:![][1]It has step by step instructions, not on how to draw certain characters, but on how to draw your characters. I think this will help me create my own characters while getting a lot of practice drawing. I start tomorrow with the drawing, mostly because today is filled with work, and will be trying to post to [Fancy Cadaver][2] every day. Check it out.

[![][3]][4]I also have started updating Veggie Fight again. Though I have killed the story about the tomato that wants to be a boxer, I will be updating it more frequently. I am planning on using it as a place to experiment with comics and to use my new found drawing abilities to actually create something.

You might be wondering how you can keep track of all of this stuff seeing as how it is spread all over the internet. I would suggest either subscribe to each site, which you can do at each site, or you can just follow me on [twitter][5] where I will be posting every time I post something at any of the sites.

Everyone have a nice Tuesday and look forward to Dylan's Great Drawing Experiment (or DGDE) to start tomorrow. And thanks for all of the birthday wishes, it was nice to hear from everyone.
