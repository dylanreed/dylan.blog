Yesterday's [post][1] was bad, really bad. I had a point in that post, I know I did, but I missed it due to my brain wondering.  I am sorry about that. Rather than going back and trying to figure out what in god's name I was trying to write I will just move on and hope for the best.

Recently I have been fairly in control of my ADHD. For some reason this semester I have been able to focus more and my mind is wondering less. I guess that a lapse in this is to be expected at some point I was just hoping that it would happen in the middle of the summer instead of in the spring.

Now that it has happened I am racking my brain to figure out what I need to do to get back on track. I am not even sure what I did to control the wondering before. I am pretty sure I got a good handle on it after I read the Tao of Pooh so maybe it is time to read it again.

I am slightly annoyed by the fact that my control is slipping and want to get that control back. Stupid brain wondering off, please come back.
