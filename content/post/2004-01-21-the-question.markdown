  content: hmm, when i was scuba diving, there was some definite polar bear wrestling.
    i thought "just keep swimming" and everything turned out dandy.

    Seaworld is a bunch of posers.  Their website suggests that polar bears cannot dive further than 20 ft.

    At least they concede that NO ONE actually knows how deep polar bears can dive.  The way that I figure is if Dylan can dive to 300 feet, so can a bear.

    Have you ever seen a giant squid eating a submarine?

  content: "Listen Scott,\n I realize that you think that a polar bear could take
    me but whatever. I got this from a webpage so it must be true. \n\nSwimming and
    Diving\n\nPolar bears are strong swimmers, they can swim several hours at a time
    over long distances. A polar bear's front paws propel them through the water dog-paddle
    style, while the hind feet and legs are held flat and are used as rudders. Polar
    bears can obtain a swimming speed of 10 kph. The hair of a polar bear easily shakes
    free of water and any ice that may form after swimming. Polar bears will also
    swim to cool down on warm days or after physical activity.\n\nPolar bears make
    shallow dives when stalking prey, navigating ice floes, or searching for kelp.
    The polar bear's nostrils close when under water. A thick layer of fat, up to
    11 cm thick, keeps the polar bear warm while swimming in cold water. Polar bears
    usually swim under water at depths of only about 3 to 4.5 m. They can remain submerged
    for as long as two minutes. No one knows how deep a polar bear can dive. One researcher
    estimates that polar bears dive no deeper than 6 m.  \n\n so according to this
    I just need to swim fast.\n\nAs far as Squids eating submarines, I don't think
    that a giant squid could get on land to get to a Subway sandwich store. OK no
    i think the problem is that metal is really hard to chew through.\n\nPlease ask
    better questions seriously\n\nDylan\n"

Harper kept wanting me to tell people about the email i got from one of his friends so i'll re post it

Hi,

I'm a friend of Harper's, and he was telling me about your diving job.

We began to wonder a couple of things about diving.

For instance, if you had to fight a monkey underwater, assuming that the

Monkey was a well-trained diver (he's a natural in the water and very athletic), and the Monkey was equipped with a knife and the necessary skills to use it, who would win this battle? Also, if you needed a weapon to even the playing field, could you use a really sharp fireman?s axe?

Also, have you ever been attacked at a depth of 300 feet or more by a polar bear, and if so, what did you do to survive?

Thanks!

Scott

On the first question about the monkey, the monkey would obviously win due to the fact that he is very athletic and has a knife. Now adding the "really sharp fireman?s ax" into the equation forces one to consider the hydrodynamics and weight of the ax. Archimedes Principle states that the amount of water displaced by an object is equal to its buoyancy (i.e. if you get in a bathtub full of water, water will spill out if you catch all the water that exited the pool the weight of that water is equal to the force buoying you up.) Imagine if you will placing said fire ax into a pool of water. It would only displace a small amount of water, so it would be very negatively buoyant. So if both the monkey and I were neutrally buoyant (displacing the same amount of water as you weigh) fighting in midwinter, then having the fire ax would be a further disadvantage to me. However if I wrapped the fire ax in neoprene to make it neutrally buoyant, I would be able to wield it more effectively. The only problem left is hydrodynamics. I would have to swing the axe moving both my arm and the ax through water, where as the monkey would only have to move his arm since a knife as a weapon is pretty much an extension of the arm. If the monkey was using a standard military issue special forces k-bar knife I would probably be dead in about 30 secs +or - 5 secs.

No I have never been attacked by a polar bear in 300 feet of water or otherwise. However I do not think that a polar bear can even dive down to 300 feet. I might be wrong though. That is all.

ok tell everyone about it harper including mark
