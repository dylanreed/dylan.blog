Have you ever seen a street performer? If you live in or near a big city you probably have. One thing you might have noticed is their ability to hold an audience. This is the most important skill of street performing, because the more people you have standing around you the more tips you can potentially get.

For a long time most street performers where jugglers\comedians or musicians, however, recently there has been an upwelling of street magicians. Street Magic as it is called is basically using magic to amaze people on the street (duh). There are few rules as to what tricks can be done they just have to be portable and have very few angle problems. Some common tricks are Two Card Monte and the King Rising Levitation. Most good street magic relies on few gimmicks and more skill with slight of hand.
