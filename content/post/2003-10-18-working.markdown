So ican get on the internet at work if i work at the right computer. so thats good. i am so tired and annoyed. i worked this morning from 11am-2pm and then tonight i am working 5pm until 12:30am. what has me annoyed is that some of the people that i work with got to go home early even though they all came in at 6pm. wtf. i have been working longer hours wise as well as i have been employed longer. plus theses to people are getting out of a lot of the cleaning that goes on at the end of the night. its bullshit.  
thats all good night.
