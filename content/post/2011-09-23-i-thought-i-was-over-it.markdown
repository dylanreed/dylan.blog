But I am not. I am speaking of course about video games. I haven't been playing them very much lately. In fact I wasn't playing them at all. Then I started working from home and needed something to relieve the stress. It started with Civ V, then Cities in Motion, then Arkham Asylum(again) and then Saints Row 2. I have made the mistake of looking at what games are coming out before Xmas and there are too many good ones. Modern Warfare 3, New Elder Scrolls, Saints Row 3, Arkham City, Bioshock 3(which comes out after Xmas) and many many more.

I find this irritating because I thought I had moved past video games as a hobby and now I know that I am smack dab in the middle of them again. Like I said irritating. However, in all fairness, I have to say...
