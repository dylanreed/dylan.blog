My las entry was about Orcas. I figure I should give the masses a little bit of info on other scary creatures of the sea. Over the next couple of weeks I will due a series of stories about crazy deadly creatures. Most likely in this order:  
1. Blue Ringed Octopus (2/7)  
2. Great White Sharks (2/10)  
3. Moray Eels (2/12)  
4. Humboldt Squid (2/16)  
5. Tiger Sharks (2/20)  
After that i will take suggestions on what else to write about. **_Mark_**_ this means you. Email to me or post them as comments. And don't worry nothing is true. OK it might be.
