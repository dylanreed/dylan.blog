  content: Life seriously sucks. I hate people and I wish they would all  just leave
    me alone. My idea of the perfect life is one with no one in it. Cept me of course.
    No guys. I think i'm going to become president and like lock them all under ground
    only to be used for breeding purposes. Then if it turns out to be a male child,
    we make the losers down under take care of them. Hopefully they'll all drown in
    their slobbish pigsty that it's going to turn out to be when there are no women
    to clean their hole in the ground up. Ok that's all i have to say for today.

    study! And I bet you'll end up with a much better life! Make that change today!

I AM SO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW. mostly because of work. my hours have been cut from 40 to 10 a week. that sux. so right now i am activly seeking another form of money making. so i am very frustrated. on the good side i am having plenty of time to do my homework. which i guess is good. granted i am going to have to live on the street and eat maggots but at least i will have time to get my homework done....thats good....right. on an actually positive note i think that i might have a job next year with the ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. Sweet. i t pays well and i might actually get to dive. sso that is good. How is everyone else doing. thats good. if anyone feels sorry for me you could donate a lot of money. love dylan
