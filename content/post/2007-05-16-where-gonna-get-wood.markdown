floors. Sarah and I figured out somethings and are going to start saving to put wood floors down in our condo. We figure we need to save for four to six months in order to be able to put them in the whole house. During the months of saving we will be planning and trying to decide what kind of wood and finish that we want.

In order to save money we will most likely install it ourselves. If anyone has done this please let me know: Is it really hard to do? How hard is it to do stairs? Where you got your floors?
