As Sarah and I have been trying to take care of our debt we have realized two things.

One is that once credit cards have you they will do as little as possible to keep you as a customer. This is because that once you owe them over $1000.00 they will get enough money in interest to not need you as a customer. I think that credit cards as an idea are a good thing. I just feel that in practice they are lacking in customer service and a need to please customers to keep them.

The second thing is that everyone has this problem. You can almost not function without a credit card in the world today. It is a sad fact of life and there is little you can do about it unless you are independently wealthy.

Here are [two][1] [articles][2] that might help others stop the flow of bad debt choices by all.
