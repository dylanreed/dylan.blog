![preview1][1] Since I am trying to be a good little video blogger and do the proper branding to my player I am asking for your help. I have created a few different designs for my player. I think my favorite is the BunnyLupe one. The carrot is a close second and the robot is the third one. Also please let me know if you like the dark player or the light player better. Thanks
