Hello everyone,

How are you doing. Me I am sweet. I have almost completed my southpark collection. it was scary for a while but now it is good. I am sorry to say that i can't have them all but i will someday. I hope everyone is well and i hope you are all showering regularly. I am annoyed at school right now because my teacher dosen't know what he is talking about and he needs help to teach all the time. However I am getting an A so i don't really care. I had to do 20 pushups yesterday because I am a smart ass and that sucked. I am buff now but it still sucked. I just sit around all the time and play gta3. don't worry harper yours is coming. Sarah your my everything. thats all. goodbye

Dylan reed
