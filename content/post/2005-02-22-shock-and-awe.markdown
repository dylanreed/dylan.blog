So as part of my new shck and awe campaign I decided to update my blog. Are you shocked or awed? please check one. 

So I have a new job. I work for this company called community advantage which is owned by rescare. What I am is the SLS coordinator. It basically means that I in charge of services in larimer county. yep the whole place. SLS or supported living services is for people who are developmentally disabled. we basically provide assitance around the home and community. helping them become more independent. basically in a perfect world we would work are selves out of a job. the greatest thing about it is that I have very little experiance and yet I am still ruling the work. It is fun to have a 40 hour a week job that they can't just fire me for no reason. 

Before i got this job I worked for community advantage as a sls provider. so I basically became my own boss. its sweet
