<h4>Synopsis</h4>

The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices plastered on lampposts and billboards. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. 

Within these nocturnal black-and-white striped tents awaits an utterly unique, a feast for the senses, where one can get lost in a maze of clouds, meander through a lush garden made of ice, stare in wonderment as the tattooed contortionist folds herself into a small glass box, and become deliciously tipsy from the scents of caramel and cinnamon that waft through the air. 

<h4>Review</h4>

I am not entirely sure what I just read. It was enjoyable, but I am not sure what the story was. The descriptions of the acts of the circus were a feast for the senses and I wanted nothing more than to go to the circus after reading this book. 

When I say I am not sure what the story was, that isn't a bad thing. It was a fantastic journey and I will probably read it again when I have a chance.
