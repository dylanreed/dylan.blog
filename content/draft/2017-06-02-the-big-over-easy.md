<h4>Synopsis</h4>

Meet Inspector Jack Spratt, family man and head of the Nursery Crime Division. Heâ€™s investigating the murder of ovoid D-class nursery celebrity Humpty Dumpty, found shattered to death beneath a wall in a shabby area of town. Yes, the big egg is down, and all those brittle pieces sitting in the morgue point to foul play.
