![Happy New Year!!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/other/20172018.jpg)

So last year I set some goals. Reading goals, writing goals, bowtie goals, and blogging goals. Sadly I didn't complete any of those goals. But that is the good part about goals is that if you don't reach them... you can try again. Or you can set better goals. 

I am going to keep the sixty new books goal. I read almost sixty book this year, but only about half of them were new to me. This year I am going to continue a bunch of the series' that I started in 2017.
