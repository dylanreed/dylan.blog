For the first time in my writing career I am actively trying to learn about writing. Prior to this I did a great job of reading a lot of summaries of writing teaching. I read lists and blog posts about writing, and wanted them to provide me with the road map to writing. Sadly, that isnâ€™t necessarily the best way to learn how to write well.

I already own a lot of books on writing. I have even read a couple of them, but I have never actively tried to read them and then follow the exercises to attempt to get better. Instead I assumed that I would absorb the teaching without exercising my brain.

But no more. I just finished a book on plotting (*20 Master Plots and How to Build Them* by Ronald B. Tobias). Currently I am reading *Steering the Craft* by Ursula K. Le Guin. It is the most robust book on writing that I have ever read and the exercises should be very helpful.

One good thing about reading these books after I have finished writing three full novel length manuscripts is I can look back on those and figure out what went right and what went wrong. The tricky part is deciding if I should attempt to rewrite those or start something new.

I love all of the ideas of my first novels, but I worry that I am too in love with the ideas to effectively rewrite them. A path forward I have considered is writing short stories instead. Focus on learning how to construct a story in short form and then worry about writing a novel. Knowing me I will probably try to do some weird version that combines both of them. We shall see.

The important thing is that I am back to writing daily, though I try to take one weekend day off.

In other writing news: I am writing this on a Freewrite typewriter thing that Harper got me. There is something so nice about just writing and not worrying about spelling or other errors. Not being able to edit as I go is probably going to make me put more words to paper.

The most important thing I am doing now is celebrating the journey to story, rather than focusing on the endgame. Yay.
