For about the last year I have been working in web3. It has been interesting but I think the more interesting story is how I got here. Let's take it way back to see how I ended up in this crazy new internet world. 

I have been tech adjacent for my entire life, mostly thanks to Harper. Because of this I have been a happy user of technology and have played with a lot of new technology as it has been released. But I have always been hesitent to work in tech or to becoem a developer. This was the best decision I could have made. 

In my life I have been lucky to have worked in sooo many fields and because of that I have expereince working with a ton of different people in different places in their lives. Throughout my life I have been honing my skills with people, often saying that my one true skill is communicating with people.
