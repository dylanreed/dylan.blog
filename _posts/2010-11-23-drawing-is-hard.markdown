  content: 'On first glance, here''s what stood out to me: head/neck are too small.
    Left leg doesn''t have a knee. Forshortening on the right leg is good until the
    ankle. You may also want to rework the twist. I think there are too many rotations
    in there. Does that make sense?'

<blockquote>I am procrastinating the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylansarah/5188060095/">project</a> I am supposed to be working on by coming up with projects for myself for the coming year. Here is the first project you will see updated at least weekly on dylanreed.com.</blockquote><br />
Since I was a small child I have been fascinated by comics. Actually that isn't entirely true. I think the actual day that my interest in comic started was in 6th grade homeroom. I say next to David Kopp and while we were supposed to do something he would draw comic book figures and I would be amazed. From that point on I was interested in comics and wished I could draw comics.</p>
<p>Fast forward a number of years (about 16 I think) and I am in art school and studying drawing. What an perfect&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;to learn to draw comics. Of course the problem is that comics are not considered an art form at my school so doing it for a project would never work out. But... I am taking a year off from school so I could in my free time learn to draw super heros.</p>
<p>Here is the plan. I have five books on drawing super heros. The plan is to make it through one book a month and then draw the same drawing at the end of each month. In theory it should get better. I picked a page from one of the books and attempted to draw the pose on that page as a baseline.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed I made some notes of what I think needs to be better. His foot shape is terrible and his&nbsp;straighter&nbsp;leg is funky. Also that ankle is really really skinny. His hand, the one in the front looks special. And his face is grey... because I don't have a flesh tone marker, I <a href="http://www.dickblick.com/lists/wishlist/3D7SKCUGDOZQY/publicview/">could</a>, but I don't. I am not sure what else looks weird so please help. There is a chance that his torso is off but I am not sure.</p>
