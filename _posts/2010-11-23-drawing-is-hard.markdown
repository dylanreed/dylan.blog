  content: 'On first glance, here''s what stood out to me: head/neck are too small.
    Left leg doesn''t have a knee. Forshortening on the right leg is good until the
    ankle. You may also want to rework the twist. I think there are too many rotations
    in there. Does that make sense?'

> I am procrastinating the [project][1] I am supposed to be working on by coming up with projects for myself for the coming year. Here is the first project you will see updated at least weekly on dylanreed.com.

Since I was a small child I have been fascinated by comics. Actually that isn't entirely true. I think the actual day that my interest in comic started was in 6th grade homeroom. I say next to David Kopp and while we were supposed to do something he would draw comic book figures and I would be amazed. From that point on I was interested in comics and wished I could draw comics.

Fast forward a number of years (about 16 I think) and I am in art school and studying drawing. What an perfect opportunity to learn to draw comics. Of course the problem is that comics are not considered an art form at my school so doing it for a project would never work out. But... I am taking a year off from school so I could in my free time learn to draw super heros.

Here is the plan. I have five books on drawing super heros. The plan is to make it through one book a month and then draw the same drawing at the end of each month. In theory it should get better. I picked a page from one of the books and attempted to draw the pose on that page as a baseline.

As you may have noticed I made some notes of what I think needs to be better. His foot shape is terrible and his straighter leg is funky. Also that ankle is really really skinny. His hand, the one in the front looks special. And his face is grey... because I don't have a flesh tone marker, I [could][4], but I don't. I am not sure what else looks weird so please help. There is a chance that his torso is off but I am not sure.
