excerpt: If you ask most people what is the most dangerous creature in the ocean,
  most will answer Great White Sharks.  Well this is a gross misunderstanding.  Great
  white sharks are huge and can kill you but typically attack only things that look
  like their normal food.  There are many other creatures in the world that will attack
  humans more ferociously then great white sharks.  For instance, Tiger Sharks.

  content: I may or may not agree with what you said but I wanted to take the time
    to thank you for noting that the information is your opinion. That was very journalistically

If you ask most people what is the most dangerous creature in the ocean, most will answer Great White Sharks. Well this is a gross misunderstanding. Great white sharks are huge and can kill you but typically attack only things that look like their normal food. There are many other creatures in the world that will attack humans more ferociously then great white sharks. For instance, Tiger Sharks.  
Here is some information I found on tiger sharks on the web. Known scientifically as Galeocerdo tigrinusamong they are called tiger sharks, leopard sharks and the _**MANEATER SHARK**_ by normal people. That is one heck of a red flag to me. Tiger sharks have huge teeth that have a groove on the backside to hold their prey. Here is a quote from the [web][1] on there eating habits:  
Food Habits  
_Undoubtedly the least discriminative all species, the tiger shark has a reputation of eating almost anything. Preferred prey varies depending upon geographical region but commonly includes sea turtles, rays, other sharks, bony fishes, sea birds, dolphins, squid, various crustaceans and carrion. _**The tiger shark's highly serrated teeth combined with the saw-like action from shaking the head back and forth allows it to tear chunks from much larger marine animals.**_ Interestingly, it is not uncommon to find objects of human origin in this animal's stomach. One large female caught off the north end of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea contained two empty cans, a plastic bottle, two burlap sacks, a squid, and a 20 cm (8 in) fish. Garbage and refuse is often recovered from the stomachs of sharks caught in harbors and river inlets where it is commonly dumped into the water. **_Although far from a natural food item, human remains sometime end up in the guts of these scavenging sharks._** Tiger sharks are solitary hunters that feed primarily at night as the shark moves further inshore and closer to the surface. Tiger sharks are sometimes seen in groups of several but this is probably a result of congregations of food items in the vicinity. _  
I find that quite interesting that garbage and other human refuse was found in the shark?s mouth. One other thing that I found out was that tiger sharks are second only to great whites in number of attacks on humans. Therefore, my earlier statement might seem untrue now. Keep in mind that great whites typically attack people on surfboards and tiger sharks will attack divers underwater just because they are hungry. Here is a quote from another [webpage][2]: _Tiger sharks sometimes eat people, whereas other species seem to attack humans primarily when mistaking them for typical prey, such as sea lions. _  
Please keep in mind that most of these facts are my opinion. My only credentials are that I am a diver and I love dangerous creatures. Many of my underwater facts come from [Scott Cassell][3], lectures from the [College of Oceaneering ][4]and bored [web surfing][5]. That is all.
