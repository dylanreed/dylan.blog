<p>I have recently started writing regularly on clowning. I have an entry up on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and actually have about 2 months worth of entries planned. Check it out at <a href="http://www.clownusability.com">The Usable Clown.</a></p>
<p>--Hi Ho--</p>
<p>Recently, as <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2007/10/17/tell-him-to-stay-in-his-tree/">Harper</a> posted, our fathers skin has taken a note from Dubya and declared WWIII on our dad. Apparently his skin dosen't believe that his nucular program in for peaceful uses and has decided to bring the noise regadless of what the rest of his body says about it.  So he is currently at the Mayo Clinic with Harper and my mom. I was unable to go as someone had to run Property Technica.</p>
<p>--Hi Ho--</p>
<p>Sarah and I went and saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0815244/">Sydney White</a> and it was good. Harper probably wouldn't like it as it isn't "cool" and is pretty much a romantic comdey of sorts. Whatever anyone says <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0004789/">Amanda Bynes</a> is really funny.</p>
<p>--Hi Ho--</p>
<p>I read Slapstick again.</p>
<p>--Hi Ho--</p>
<p>Does anyone else find it humorless that in the first <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0079588/">Muppet Movie</a> Kermit the Frog refuses to be the spokesfrog for a frog leg restaurant and fights against it the whole movie and yet <a href="http://ljs.winnercomm.com/Pepes_Lounge.html">Pepe the King Prawn</a> has become the spokesshrimp for Long John Silvers. I am not saying that it is because <a href="http://muppets.go.com/">Disney</a> owns the Muppets and so they promote selling out amongst the characters, but what other reason is there.</p>
<p>--Hi Ho--</p>
