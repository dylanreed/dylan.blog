![Week Six - Dylan looking insane at the end of a panoramic of Wellington NZ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/other/reboot.jpg)

To start, I want to make it clear that I am not dead. I kind of disappeared from this blog, but I am back and I am going to attempt to get back into the swing of blogging. 

My time away from the blog took away a large part of my motivation to meet my goals for the year. Luckily the year isn't over yet, and while I might be hard pressed to read all 60 new books this year I should be able to get my bow ties made. 

I was in a bad place professionally for a while and I spent a lot of my time trying to figure out how to be happy again. I had a lot of support from friends and family and I am in a much better place now then I was. 

On the positive side of things: I started a new job and we got a new kitten. Both things happened in the last month and have been a huge change for me and Sarah. Jeff is the cat's name and my new job is with a Hospice company. 

Stay tuned for more updates to come.
