<li>I am growing facial hair for the first time. It is pretty hilarious and also a little bit itchy. I am hoping to have some fancy facial hair for our trip to Japan.</li>
<li>I have started to make little felt creatures and am trying to sell them on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5066104" target="_blank">etsy</a>. I hope to become sucessful at this and even if I am not they are fun to build. Any good ideas on what sorts of creatures need to be made let me know. </li>
<li>I am loving our new TV. It is huge, so huge that it dosen't fit where it is supposed to. I think that my dad and I can fix that.</li>
<li>I am loving Super Mario Galaxy. It is very well made and makes all other wii games less fun to play because I cannot fly through space around objects.</li>
<li>Sarah and I are playing Super Mario World. It is so much fun and is as enjoyable as Galaxy. We did have to break down and buy a classic controller since Nintendo mapped the controls to the Wavebird like a retarded monkey having sex with a doorknob.</li>
<li>I just rented Mass Effect, so I want to go home and play it. Stupid work getting in the way of playing games.</li></ol></p>
