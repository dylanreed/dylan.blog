![And so it begins - Door Mat that says There are a bunch of cats in here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/Cats.png)

I am at a small crossroads in my writing. It is a wonderful crossroads, but one I haven't come to before. When I first came to it, I panicked. But I have come to realize that I am lucky to find myself here. 

One path is continuing to try and fix my first novel. To start and complete another rewrite, because it still doesn't feel right. Using the feedback I have recieved from people I respect to try and make it the best story possible. 

The other path is to let it go. To realize that since it was my first novel that it has A LOT of problems that won't be fixed easily. To instead focus on a new project. 

The second path doesn't mean the end of the line for Calliope or the world I have created. It means that it is going to sit in a virtual box and be left alone until I am able to give it the attention it deserves.

I have already started on the second path. I have been outlining and planning new stories and that is going to be my focus for the rest of 2018: to produce new works and become a better writer.
