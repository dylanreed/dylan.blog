So the Last couple of weeks have been out of control.

1st: Sarah got a new JOB at a new bank. No more UCB for her nothing but NFB from here on out. 

2nd work is crazy crazy crazy. So much to do not enough time some days to much other days. Must budget time better. Stupid time...always getting in my way.

3rd: I am clowning my fool head off. First I performed at both eaton and lasalle days then I gave a circus day presentation at Highland Early Childhood Center. This sunday I will be at the Arts Picnic in Greeley. The Following saturday is the ault day parade I am in. The weekend after that is the Rat race.

Also we got a new Kitty his name is Reno.
