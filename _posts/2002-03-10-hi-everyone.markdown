Hi again its me. I've been busy lately streetperforming. i found a couple of good places to perform at and am having fun. school is good. we did what is called the darth Vader project. we had to place 7 pieces of pipe, each piece weighs about 200lbs, following a diagram. my team got it done in 40mins (a record time) but then are teacher was able to loosen two of our bolts by hand which resulted in a 10min penelty. are total time was 50 mins which was still faster then the other 4 teams from my class. woohoo. next weekend sarah comes out and i get to see her for a whole week yippee!!
