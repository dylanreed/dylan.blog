<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No its true i do. I really suck down the pepsi. I'm not kidding. Another thing I suck at is updating my page. I did however find the <a href="http://www.minimania.com/images/webstuff/parismini/bigpics/mini%20cabrio%20r.jpg" target="_blank">perfect car for harper</a> I mean its perfect.<br />
Work is good. I enjoy it lots. lots and lots. more then sleeping. well maybe not. I do however like reading <a href="http://www.danbrown.com" target="_blank">dan brown</a> he rules. I would suggest digital fortress, then deception point and then angels and demons, and lastly davinci code</p>
<p>thats all</p>
