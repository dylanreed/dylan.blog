<p>Sorry it has been so long since i last wrote but alas i have been working. I am workin for <a href="http://www.cooperheat-mqs.com">COOPERHEAT-MQS</a> It is alot of fun but also the work isn't especially steady. I mostly do magnetic particle inspections and also some Dye Penetrant inspections. This past weekend I got to work on a heat treating job in Longmont at a company called TANCO. Tanco build humongous tanks and we have to heat treat them. It basically involves heating them up to between 1100 and 1600f and then cooling them at 200 degrees an hour.<br />
I am happy to be back in Colorado for good i missed all the cold and the bad drivers and also sarah and mom and dad. I have been spendin alot of time with sarah and enjoy every second of it. well that is all for now. I love everything</p>
