<p>Recently at work I got a new vehicle. It is a 2002 Ford Focus ZX3. It has just over 70,000 miles, though most of those where spent being towed behind a motor home. Because of that it has some pretty funny graphics on the side, <img height="134" src="http:&#47;&#47;farm2.static.flickr.com&#47;1244&#47;544197567_440f19c666.jpg?v=0" width="240" align="left"&#47;>probably to match the motor home. It is in really good shape and is fun to drive since it has a stick shift. The other fun thing is that it is a car that is represented in Forza 2 so I can have fun designing paint jobs for a car I actually drive. I have spent probably an hour working on the Property Technica Frog to put on the hood as well as getting the placement of both the AMPS and Property Technica logos. I have taken some pictures of them and will post them once they pop up on the Forza website.&nbsp;
