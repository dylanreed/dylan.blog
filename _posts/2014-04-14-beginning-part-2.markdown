The first time is always the hardest. My first time consisted of me flailing about and getting lucky. Apparently when you call yourself the Glass Jaw, you’re not kidding. After that I decided to learn how to be a proper hero, cape and all. Well actually not a cape. I had to many nightmares about hanging myself on a fire escape to truly be comfortable wearing a cape in public. Maybe if I ever need an awesome picture I'll wear it... 

Anyway. For me being a hero, I still hesitate to put super in there, started without much excitement. My family wasn't rich or special. I am not an alien (I don't think so anyway). My parents were killed on the way out of a theater but I wasn't with them. I was two. I don't even remember them. Insert any sort of orphan/raised in the system issue here. I probably have them all. But no matter what happened to me when I was younger that isn't why I became a hero. 

Some of the others I have met have awesome origin stories. I don't. I started when I was twenty-eight; twenty-eight and out of shape. I used to do gymnastics, dance and be buff. But on my 28th birthday I noticed the existence of a gut and that I got winded going up stairs. I new I needed to make a change. So I headed to the gym. After signing for a yearlong contract and getting a free personal training session, which only confirmed what I already knew, I decided to do what anyone my age would do at a gym. Sit on my ass and read a magazine. Since I know that I am not ever going to be as in shape the people in the magazine I could at least look like I was thinking about it. 

As a force of habit I started in the back of the magazine, looking at the ads that are placed back there for products and services. I came across an ad for Hero Courses. I pretended I didn't care about that while I carefully tore the ad out of the magazine. I took that two-inch by two-inch square and quickly left the gym and headed home. 

The ad was for a correspondence course in being a super hero. I got online and after looking through all of the options I ordered the starter kit. Shipping was pretty quick and it arrived in three days. I am pretty sure I was unbearable during that time. I tracked the package on my phone, whenever I was near a computer; I even called UPS to make sure they hadn't lost it. 

The package was a simple brown box, completely nondescript. Which makes sense since you don’t want to advertise that you are becoming a superhero in case you neighbor is a villain. Just saying. The box contained only five things: a book of exercises, a book about naming your hero persona, a domino mask, a pair of gloves and a catalog. 

The catalog was amazing. It was where you could purchase everything you need for being a hero. It had utility belts, costumes, weapons and gadgets. You could order a starter package that included a belt, a simple costume and some investigation gear or you could order everything piece meal and get what you need. 

Since this was going to be my new career I decided to go all out. I contacted their costume department and started work on getting my costume designed. I decided to go with purple and orange as my color scheme. It was going to take a couple of weeks to get my costume so I spent that time trying to get into shape and studying the art of super heroing.
