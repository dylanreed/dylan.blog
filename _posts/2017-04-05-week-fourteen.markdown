Still adjusting to taking medication for my ADHD. When I am productive, I am super productive. But when I am distracted it is the same. Also getting adjusted to meds is weird because my body doesn't know what to do. Sleeping is hard, but I have learned that it really isn't. I have been waking up feeling rested, which is strange because I feel like I am not sleeping. I am pretty sure that my brain is just being a butthead and dreaming about not sleeping. What a creep!!

I am still in love with the ukulele. It is so much fun to play and I find it calming. There are some chords that are stupid and hard to play but I am learning. It seems to be the chords that use all four of my fingers that give me the most trouble. My secret joy is scales. I love playing them, gradually speeding up and then BAM!! warp speed. 

My writing schedule is going well. I have loaded myself up with lots of different projects, which is great. But... I am not always good at staying on task. Currently I am rewriting Calliope and the Living Biologic, first edits of Rio Borealis, and planning The Problem with Portal Five. The nice thing about this schedule is that it allows me to practice many different parts of writing that I am not very good at. 

Don't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)
