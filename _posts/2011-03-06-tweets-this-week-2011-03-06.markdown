  * I am so done with this cold. I hate it [#][1]
  * Ice Cream then Nyquil then reading then bed... then... feeling better. Or I will be so pissed. [#][2]
  * I need 3 bracketed images for sarah... who can help? it is for the children [#][3]
  * Sarah just got me with the What? joke. @[harper][4] knows what I am talking about. Curse that smart smart girl [#][5]
  * 8oz of water, a splash of vinegar and a tsp of salt solves all you sore throat woes. Just gargle it a couple times a day. [#][6]
  * Trying to figure out how to juggle a hot pot of tea, a mug and my nook in a bathtub... this may end in tears [#][7]
  * Do I lose nerd cred if I am playing tabletop RPG at 830 in the morning? Are they something that is meant to be played at night? [#][8]
  * getting ready to go to lunch with my mom, maybe grab a new printer and then do dishes/laundry. Also I feel almost human today [#][9]
  * New printer all setup... oh and it has a scanner! [#][10]
  * Said scanner is also wireless... which is awesome because I hate wires [#][11]
