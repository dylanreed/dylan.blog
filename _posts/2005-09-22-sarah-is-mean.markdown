<p>I have politely told sarah that she should read enders game by orson scott card. She has done nothing but make fun of me for being a huge dork ever since. ok ok she has only made empty threats about not reading it when i am a shit to her. whatever life is so much aboutthe details.</p>
<p>unfortunatly i cannot remember the details, to many clubs to the head i guess. like when we where on our way home from vegas we stopped in blah blah utah because I wanted a Jamba Juice. sarah not being able to have dairy got nothing.</p>
<p>However just the other day i was being sassy and I told her something about how when I asked her isf she wanted jamba juice she screeched NOOOOOO!</p>
<p>so she threatend to not read the book</p>
<p>that is all</p>
<p>oh and SARAH!!! found the Jamba Juice so without her I woundn't have gotten the sweet nector of Coldbuster that I so crave. She Knows that man.</p>
<p>curse you editor</p>
