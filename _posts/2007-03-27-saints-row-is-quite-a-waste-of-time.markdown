<p>Now I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean that this game can suck you right into it with all of the mini-games forcing you to spend hours and hours completing them without necessarily completing any part of the actual story line (other then the first quick mission). <&#47;p>
<p>Having had this game for a while I can say that it is a game that has a high rating on the screw around scale but a low rating on me caring about the story. I have yet to finish the game. I got really close once and when I couldn't kill the last Los Canales guy after two tries I quit caring. I just focused on getting all of the other parts of the game done.<&#47;p>
<p>My favorite part of the game which isn't even a mandatory part of the game are the garages where you can "pimp" out your cars. I spend more time playing with that and fixing up cars that I am always poor in the game. I have had to figure out ways to make money with the mini games in order to support my car modding habit. <&#47;p>
<p>The overall gameplay is slicker then <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Take-2-Grand-Theft-Auto&#47;dp&#47;B000FRU1UM&#47;ref=pd_bbs_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032269&amp;sr=1-1">GTA<&#47;a>, there are no load times or waiting to have access to other parts of the game. This leads to a lot of exploring of areas you don't&nbsp;need until later in the game. While this really isn't a problem, except it causes you to waste a lot of time just playing around without accomplishing anything.<&#47;p>
<p>I would say that if <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;THQ-752919550021-Saints-Row&#47;dp&#47;B000BLM5PG&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032231&amp;sr=8-1">Violition<&#47;a> would have put motorcycles, boats and planes like GTA then it would have been an actual <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Take-2-Grand-Theft-Auto&#47;dp&#47;B000FRU1UM&#47;ref=pd_bbs_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032269&amp;sr=1-1">GTA<&#47;a> killer, right now it is a great game that is like GTA but missing some features. I feel that if <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Take-2-Grand-Theft-Auto&#47;dp&#47;B000FRU1UM&#47;ref=pd_bbs_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032269&amp;sr=1-1">Rockstar<&#47;a>r and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;THQ-752919550021-Saints-Row&#47;dp&#47;B000BLM5PG&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032231&amp;sr=8-1">Violition<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Microsoft-Crackdown&#47;dp&#47;B000HCQK0A&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032312&amp;sr=1-1">Realtime Worlds<&#47;a> joined forces...the next sandbox game would be out of control. Seriously.<&#47;p></p>
