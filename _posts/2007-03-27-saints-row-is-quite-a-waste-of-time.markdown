<p>Now I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean that this game can suck you right into it with all of the mini-games forcing you to spend hours and hours completing them without necessarily completing any part of the actual story line (other then the first quick mission). </p>
<p>Having had this game for a while I can say that it is a game that has a high rating on the screw around scale but a low rating on me caring about the story. I have yet to finish the game. I got really close once and when I couldn't kill the last Los Canales guy after two tries I quit caring. I just focused on getting all of the other parts of the game done.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the game which isn't even a mandatory part of the game are the garages where you can "pimp" out your cars. I spend more time playing with that and fixing up cars that I am always poor in the game. I have had to figure out ways to make money with the mini games in order to support my car modding habit. </p>
<p>The overall gameplay is slicker then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Take-2-Grand-Theft-Auto/dp/B000FRU1UM/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032269&amp;sr=1-1">GTA</a>, there are no load times or waiting to have access to other parts of the game. This leads to a lot of exploring of areas you don't&nbsp;need until later in the game. While this really isn't a problem, except it causes you to waste a lot of time just playing around without accomplishing anything.</p>
<p>I would say that if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/THQ-752919550021-Saints-Row/dp/B000BLM5PG/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032231&amp;sr=8-1">Violition</a> would have put motorcycles, boats and planes like GTA then it would have been an actual <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Take-2-Grand-Theft-Auto/dp/B000FRU1UM/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032269&amp;sr=1-1">GTA</a> killer, right now it is a great game that is like GTA but missing some features. I feel that if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Take-2-Grand-Theft-Auto/dp/B000FRU1UM/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032269&amp;sr=1-1">Rockstar</a>r and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/THQ-752919550021-Saints-Row/dp/B000BLM5PG/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032231&amp;sr=8-1">Violition</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Crackdown/dp/B000HCQK0A/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1175032312&amp;sr=1-1">Realtime Worlds</a> joined forces...the next sandbox game would be out of control. Seriously.</p></p>
