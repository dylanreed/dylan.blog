<h4>Synopsis</h4>

Tony Chu is a cop with a secret. A weird secret. Tony Chu is cibopathic, which means he gets psychic impressions from whatever he eats. It also means he's a hell of a detective, as long as he doesn't mind nibbling on the corpse of a murder victim to figure out whodunit, and why. It's a dirty job, and Tony has to eat terrible things in the name of justice. And if that wasn't bad enough, the government has figured out Tony Chu's secret. They have plans for him, whether he likes it or not. 

<h4>Review</h4>

This is more of a review for the entire Chew series. This is the best comic I have ever read. And I have read quite a few. Some of them have humor, others are serious. Chew has it all. Humor, serious moments, Poyo, and cannibals. It really can't be beat. 

This is the last trade paperback. Which makes this a bittersweet moment for me. I knew when I started with issue one that they were planning on sixty total issues. And they delivered. 

The end of the series, mixed with how the series ended, breaks my heart. What started as a light hearted comic turned into a wonderful story, full of amazing art and writing. 

If you read one graphic novel this year (or any year), you should read Chew. It is fantastic.
