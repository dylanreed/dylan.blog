<h4>Synopsis</h4>

Six-Gun Tarot is the first book in the twisted weird west world of the Golgotha series by R.S. Belcher.
Nevada, 1869: Beyond the pitiless 40-Mile Desert lies Golgotha, a cattle town that hides more than its share of unnatural secrets. The sheriff bears the mark of the noose around his neck; some say he is a dead man whose time has not yet come. His half-human deputy is kin to coyotes. The mayor guards a hoard of mythical treasures. A banker's wife belongs to a secret order of assassins. And a shady saloon owner, whose fingers are in everyone's business, may know more about the town's true origins than he's letting on.


<h4>Review</h4>

I wrote a space western for NaNoWriMo in 2016 and I wish I would have read this book first. While not a space western this book hits all of the awesome western tropes without being heavy handed. 

There was a lot more to this book than I picked up on initially and it has turned into one of my favorite books. The way Belcher handles the shifts in perspective is fantastic. He also gives you just enough information so that you think you know what is going on before he pulls the rug out from under you. 

This book was recommended to me by a friend and I would like to recommend that everyone add it to their reading lists.
