In a world gone mad with too many things, where are you going to look for help getting stuff done? You're going to look to me, Dylan Reed. I do stuff. Any stuff. I have been doing stuff for a number of years and am very skilled at doing stuff.

This is how I feel a lot of the time. Due to the wondering nature of my brain I have found it hard for me to enjoy any single job for longer than a couple of months. I don't have a problem keep jobs, I just have a hard time finding one that I enjoy a bunch. I wish that there was one career that I found so interesting I wanted to do nothing else. Unfortunately I have yet to find such a career.

On top of that the economy sucks, surprised? This means that finding jobs is more difficult than ever for many people and this makes it harder to get out of a job you dislike. What I am going to try to do, over the next weeks and months, is become a paid doer of stuff. This should be simple to figure out but hard to execute.

Everyone has something that they dislike doing or don't have time to do, that is where I come in. I will do anything* and you pay me for my time. This is almost an on-call service once it is set up and will save you time in the long run. I have experience doing many odd jobs:

*         Entertaining

*         General Household Maintenance

*         General Household Chores

*         Helping pack for moving

*         Picking up dog waste before parties/gatherings

*         Hosting events

*         Being an MC

*         Babysitting, no diapers

*         Pet sitting/vet visits

*         Basic Web design

*         Graphic Design

*         Writing

*         Driving

*         Messenger/Local Delivery

*         Cooking/Baking

*         Search and Recovery Diving

*         Underwater cleaning of Boats

*         More...

As you can see I have done a lot, mostly as hobbies, and I didn't even include anything I learned from jobs that I have had. That is boring stuff like cash handling, alphabetizing videos, making coffee, property management and hanging out with developmentally disabled folks.

 

*not that, sicko
