<p class="MsoNormal">In a world gone mad with too many things, where are you going to look for help getting stuff done? You&rsquo;re going to look to me, Dylan Reed. I do stuff. Any stuff. I have been doing stuff for a number of years and am very skilled at doing stuff.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is how I feel a lot of the time. Due to the wondering nature of my brain I have found it hard for me to enjoy any single job for longer than a couple of months. I don&rsquo;t have a problem keep jobs, I just have a hard time finding one that I enjoy a bunch. I wish that there was one career that I found so interesting I wanted to do nothing else. Unfortunately I have yet to find such a career.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On top of that the economy sucks, surprised? This means that finding jobs is more difficult than ever for many people and this makes it harder to get out of a job you dislike. What I am going to try to do, over the next weeks and months, is become a paid doer of stuff. This should be simple to figure out but hard to execute.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Everyone has something that they dislike doing or don&rsquo;t have time to do, that is where I come in. I will do anything* and you pay me for my time. This is almost an on-call service once it is set up and will save you time in the long run. I have experience doing many odd jobs:</p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As you can see I have done a lot, mostly as hobbies, and I didn&rsquo;t even include anything I learned from jobs that I have had. That is boring stuff like cash handling, alphabetizing videos, making coffee, property management and hanging out with developmentally disabled folks.</p></p>
