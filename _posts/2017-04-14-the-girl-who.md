<h4>Synopsis</h4>

Twelve-year-old September lives in Omaha, and used to have an ordinary life, until her father went to war and her mother went to work. One day, September is met at her kitchen window by a Green Wind (taking the form of a gentleman in a green jacket), who invites her on an adventure, implying that her help is needed in Fairyland. The new Marquess is unpredictable and fickle, and also not much older than September. Only September can retrieve a talisman the Marquess wants from the enchanted woods, and if she doesn't . . . then the Marquess will make life impossible for the inhabitants of Fairyland. September is already making new friends, including a book-loving Wyvern and a mysterious boy named Saturday. 

<h4>Review</h4>

This is an amazing [book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250010195/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dylanreed06-20). After reading [Alice](http://dylan.blog/2017/04/07/alice/) I wasn't sure I was ready for another magical adventure. But this book changed everything. 

One piece of advice that is given to authors all the time is to read a lot. This helps you become a better writer because it exposes you to a lot of different writing styles. The style this book is written in makes me want to write like this. 

Every part of this book is well thought out and the villain has reasoning for being the villain that makes everything else in the book come into a sharper focus. I couldn't put this book down. 

The creatures and characters introduced are lovely and memorable. There is nothing I would change or even criticize. Read this book now!!
