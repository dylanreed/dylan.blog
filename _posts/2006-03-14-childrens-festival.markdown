So coming up soon(April 1st) is the Childrens Festival, and boy am I excited. I believe this will be my 4th year as the MC the first year was un official and I have since just taken the position over. This year I actually joined the planning commitee which I think was a plus because it has allowed me to get the entertainment needed for this event. There is about 6 different dance groups, a group of jump ropers and a puppet show.

If you are ever going to do an event like this you should get a proper list of everything they need you to say. Last year I found out who was performing the morning of, this made it really tricky to figure out what needed to be said when. Also last year we had a problem with performers not showing up. Hoefully this year everyone shows up.
