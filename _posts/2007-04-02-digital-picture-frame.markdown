I have an old Dell Inspiron notebook that I am thinking about turning into a digital picture frame. I think that it would be a fun project and since it is kind of toast anyway it might work.

I am thinking about following [these][1] instructions to build it. I think that it should work with this laptop. Since Sarah and I have so many pictures I think it would give us a good place to display them in our house.
