<p class="MsoNormal">So the past days have been ok. I have been practicing yoyo quite a bit and I think my finger has finally adjusted to the string trying to burn its way all the way through. I have also been watching a lot of Southpark at work. It plays nicely on my monitor allowing me to work while still enjoying the Southpark. Here is a list of episodes that everyone needs to watch: Casa Bonita, Professor Chaos, Free Hat, Asspen, AWESOM-O, and All About Mormons. They all make me laugh.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I hope that soon I will get some money so I can get some new magic learning stuff. I want to start learning mentalism and read minds. I think that this will actually add a lot to my acts, allowing me to freak people even more then some of the card tricks already do. I am hoping to someday go to Chicago and visit Harper and have someone film me whilst I walk around and do street magic tricks. I feel that if I where to do street magic while in my clown outfit it would be sweet, basically follow the same formula as David Blaine only cooler.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also the new and improved <a title="Well They Are!!!!!" target="_blank" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.clownsareawesome.com">clownsareawesome<&#47;a> has been launched. Check it out. It rules.  It is made using Joomla and a modified template.  It is quite a bit of fun and very easy to use. I am planning on adding new information at least 3 times a week as well as get other clowns to contribute.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am trying to learn more about PHP, it is so hard to understand, just when I think that I have got it, it tricks me making me frustrated. On the plus side I found an easy way to fix my father in laws site so that I can work on what I want.<&#47;p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This morning Sarah and I went to my dad&Atilde;&macr;&Acirc;&iquest;&Acirc;&frac12;s shop to work on her metals project. We made jump rings, riveted stuff to other stuff, played with fire and generally had a good time. It is great to have Sarah in a class that I can help her with. I love metal, it is so much fun to build stuff out of.<&#47;p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I love Sarah a lot.<&#47;p></p>
