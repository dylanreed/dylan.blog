<p>On Friday my briefcase with all my balloon sculpture stuff was stolen. &nbsp;I keep it all in a hard briefcase. The kind of briefcase that always holds loads of cash in movies. I have had the same case for 7 or 8 years and it has served me well. &nbsp;Also in the case was about 1200 balloons, a custom balloon apron, two pumps and some stickers.</p>
<p>What is not in there is a camera so I can see the look on the face of the person who stole it when they finally get it open. Because I kept it locked. All that effort to steal something worth stealing, break into it imagining being able to sell or use the contents and bam: BALLOONS!!</p>
<ul>
<li>Briefcase: $50<&#47;li>
<li>Balloons: $60<&#47;li>
<li>Pumps: $30<&#47;li>
<li>Apron: $60<&#47;li>
<li>Turning someone from a thief to an entertainer: Priceless<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
That is my hope. That they open it up and decide to stop being a dirty stealer head and instead use the internet to become an amazing balloon artist. I would love to go to an event and see some dude with my briefcase rocking out the balloons like a boss. I wouldn't even be mad. I may ask for one of my pumps back because it is the first one I bought and I have been using it for 16 years.</p>
<p>Now I get to order another apron, a whole mess of balloons and find a new way to transport them.</p>
