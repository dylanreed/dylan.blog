On Friday my briefcase with all my balloon sculpture stuff was stolen.  I keep it all in a hard briefcase. The kind of briefcase that always holds loads of cash in movies. I have had the same case for 7 or 8 years and it has served me well.  Also in the case was about 1200 balloons, a custom balloon apron, two pumps and some stickers.

What is not in there is a camera so I can see the look on the face of the person who stole it when they finally get it open. Because I kept it locked. All that effort to steal something worth stealing, break into it imagining being able to sell or use the contents and bam: BALLOONS!!

  * Briefcase: $50
  * Balloons: $60
  * Pumps: $30
  * Apron: $60
  * Turning someone from a thief to an entertainer: Priceless
  


  
That is my hope. That they open it up and decide to stop being a dirty stealer head and instead use the internet to become an amazing balloon artist. I would love to go to an event and see some dude with my briefcase rocking out the balloons like a boss. I wouldn't even be mad. I may ask for one of my pumps back because it is the first one I bought and I have been using it for 16 years.

Now I get to order another apron, a whole mess of balloons and find a new way to transport them.
