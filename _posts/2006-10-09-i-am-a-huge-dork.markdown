This may not suprise many of you. Or any of you but there it is. I am a dork because this next Sunday I get to go to the Circus. Now that in itself isn't that different from any other year, however, this year I get to go back after the show and meet all of the clowns. I am so excited.

Some part of me secretly hopes that there is some sort of emergency that will make it so I have to go on as a clown and save the day. Like one of the clowns gets sick or something. I really don't hope that one of them get sick and I realize that I wouldn't probably go on in their place but I can dream.

The funniest thing about this is that I am as excited about this as I imagine an extreme sports fan would be about meeting their favorite team. I am so EXCITED!!!
