2. I have been working on these sites [CAA][2], API and my store. I have been learning HTML and PHP so i have made forms and what not. So i have become addicted to computers and the web thanks to harper and tommy sunshine.

5. I will start practicing the juggling a lot so I can become awesome, also I now have a video camera so i can vid my self and see what sucks.

6. I will learn more magic tricks and become awesome at them.
