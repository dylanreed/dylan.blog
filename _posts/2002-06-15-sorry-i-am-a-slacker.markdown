hi everyone i have been pretty busy at school. i made the deans list again. i think i have decided to change my coursework at school. rather then becoming a underwater medic i am going to become a non destructive tester. this will provide me with more job oppertunities in colorado and also lots more money. school is good. i am now an employee of the mormans, i work for hollywood video which is owned by mormans. it is sweet. anyway i am good. i am in love with the best person ever and i can't wait to be back home. i am 2 weeks away from being halfway done with school. sarah i love you so much. dad happy fathers day. i love everyone. dylan
