<p>I am a little more then halfway through the week and I have posted a bunny pic everyday. Go me. I am currently trying to decide what to do next week over at the <a href="http://fancycadaver.com">Cadaver</a>. I am undecided if I should do another specific animal or if I should just rock out with colored pencils. I have decided on a focus for my cartooning ideas and am going to start the character development/ script writing this weekend. Of course this weekend, for me, means Thursday and Friday since I am pretty sure I am working all weekend.</p>
<p>I will hopefully have some sort of a preview for my loyal readers (all five of you) on Monday or Tuesday of next week.</p>
