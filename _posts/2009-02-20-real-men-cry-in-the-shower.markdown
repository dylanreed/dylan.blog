<p>Recently I was given some news. It wasn&rsquo;t good or bad or even purple, it was just news. The news was shocking and stressful and everything is ok, but it was proceeded by a week of stress. This led me to spend some quality time in the shower. I find that when I am sad or stress or just feel the need to cry I go in the shower. </p>
<p>This is not born out of any need to feel like a man and not show emotion, I think it comes from a need to have the moments when I am feeling emotionally drained be private and noisy. The best place for this is the shower.</p>
<p>I always find the macho attitude of not crying in front of people in order to maintain the manly attitude to be silly. I don&rsquo;t necessarily like to cry in front of people, I will if I need to and since I am comfortable with myself don&rsquo;t feel like I have lost my manhood if I do.</p></p>
