Well crap. 

This is garbage.

But it will be OK.

This is the mantra that sometimes has to be followed. I was coming off a high last week. My reading was going great, I was making progress on my writing, and I had rediscovered my love of drawing. It was awesome!!!

And then the shit hit the fan. My dad has a weird infection and is in the hospital. And there is nothing like someone you love being in the hospital to take the wind out of your sails. 

Now the important things begin. My goals don't matter, what matters is family and being there when I can. I am luckier than most because I live in the same town as my parents. Harper is in town to help out, but he will soon be off into his crazy life again.

Someone being in the hospital isn't the hardest part. The aftermath is. Working in a nursing home/rehab facility I have learned that figuring out what to do in the aftermath of a trauma is where people really shine. 

This is when the help is gone. When you are left to deal with whatever it is without the medical professional's standing by. You are forced to put someone else's needs before your own, and it isn't hard. 

You may be tired and frustrated and scared. But when push comes to shove, you do what needs to be done. You reach down inside and find the strength and the light that your loved one needs and share it with them. 

All I want is for my dad to come home and be ok. Everyone that reads this, and can, please hug your dad for me. Or your mom. Or someone who means a lot to you.
