    you can't give us great stories and then take them away we always have to have fresh info.  that shouldn't mean that we are mean and smell bad.  we don't believe that you are sorry for taking so long.  farts smell, not people--so there!!  eat it.  sarah's so good for you we had to make sure and put in a comma.

SORRY IT HAS TAKING SO LONG.

my mom and brother came and visited. it was fun harper smells bad, all the time. I started my specialty now. i am learning to be a certified welding inspector. i am watching king of the hill it is very funny. hanks lawn has been dug up by archeologists. hee hee. i have been reading alot of school books today it was not fun the material is cool but the reading is dry. i read the devine secrets of the yaya sisterhood. it was really really good. i enjoyed the story but it was sad when vivis love died in the war.

the vault girls are big meanies and they smell bad.....except for sarah. i love sarah.
