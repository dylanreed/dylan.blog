I have been trying and trying to install Ubuntu and DSL to the purple iMac of death with no luck at all. I have basically given up and am thinking of using one of the busted up laptops instead.

I will probably use Tommy Sunshine's and a 22" CRT monitor then build the cabinet around it. I am hoping to figure out a way to add a file cabinet into the overall design so that I can weasel it into the den\study area, since it wouldn't just be video games.

I think a file cabinet MAME player that plays Ms. Pacman will go a long way to convincing Sarah that it is necessary to have in our house. Sure....that will work.

I will try the Linux nonsense on the laptops tonight.
