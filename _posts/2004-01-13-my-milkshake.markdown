So mad Fest is this weekend. Sarah and my mom and I are flying out to chi town to pick up harper and matisse and then its off to Maddison WI. Sweet. I am taking my regular unicycle as well as my giraffe unicycle and maybe my stilts.

On a less fun note i am back at school. i am taking enviormental studies, american history up until 1877 and physical geography.

I love my ipod.

thats all
