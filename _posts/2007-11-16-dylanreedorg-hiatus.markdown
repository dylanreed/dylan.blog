I am going to pause any and all writing on dylanreed.org other then personal updates for an indefinite time. This is so I can focus on writing [The Usable Clown][1], both the website and an eBook. So browse around, read old posts and know that sometime in the future I will be back.

If you really miss me head over [here][2] and read about the business of clowning.
