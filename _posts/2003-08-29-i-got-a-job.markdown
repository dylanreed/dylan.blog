Cause I'm a Hottie....Or not i am now an employee of Fort FUn in Ft collins (witty name Huh) I iwll be working there on tues and thurs during the daytime leaving plentyof time for my homework. Fort fun consists of an arcade, two golf course, a gokart track (rule) and a weird water balloon game. rock and roll.

In my super wonderful fun math for liberal arts class (read: math for stupid kids") my teacher is doing a research paper on why people hat math. Because of this we (the students) have to write a paper on our mat history. wtf. its math you add and subtract stuff. seirously.

On a lighter note our cat frida got spayed yesterday and so she has a bald belly. it is pretty funny.

I LOVE SARAH A WHOLE LOT.
