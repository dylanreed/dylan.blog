I have finally done it. 500 posts. Wow. That seems like a lot of posts but when I look back I realize that it has taken me forever to get here. I have been blogging since I started the College of Oceaneering in 2002. That is 62.5 posts a year. The year with the most posts is 2007 where I went a little crazy in the summer. 2006 and 2003 are the next highest post count. So far this year I have posted more then I did in 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2008 apparently I was busy those years.

Being awesome I am going to keep this post short and just send you to delve in to my blog. My favorite posts are all contained in one series:

  * [Killer Whales][1]

Enjoy!
