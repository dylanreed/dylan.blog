<p>This was the first time I had heard of <a href="http://www.poker-strategy.org/default.aspx?tabid=205">Full Tilt Poker Rakeback</a>  . It appears to be a place where you can go to still gamble online after all of the gambling sites blocked US accounts. Basically you have to cancel your old Full Tilt membership and start another one in order to take advantage of this program.</p>
<p>I find card games, especially poker to be more fun when played online. Like all types of gaming it seems to be more fun when you are beating complete strangers. I find most online poker services to have a teaching part of their website and this is no exception. I find that all of these teaching tools to be helpful though since I knew a little about poker already I had a hard time going through them all.</p>
<p>What I did find the Poker Strategies quite interesting, as I am always looking for better ways of using poker in my card routines, especially since these days Texas hold 'em is such a up to the minute game.</p>
<p>If you are in the mood to do some online gambling in the US then check out this site.</p>
