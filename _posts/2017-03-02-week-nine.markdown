![Week Nine - Dylan looking insane at the end of a panoramic of Wellington NZ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/weekly-blog/Weekly-Blog-Post-Nine.jpg)

This week was spent worrying about my colonoscopy for nothing. They found nothing or note. I just need to avoid stress. LOL.

In that vain I am trying to get back on track. That means: More Fiction Writing and Reading. See how I used a bunch of caps. That means it is important. 

It also means that I my blog posts may get shorter unless something crazy is happening. I recently made myself a schedule of my writing and if I follow it there will be so many more stories released. 

So... Stay tuned for that.

Don't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)
