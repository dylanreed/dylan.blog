I am writing to let everyone know about the comic they should be reading. Chew is that comic. It is one of the hardest to explain yet most enjoyable comics I have read in quite some time. Here is what the official blog says :

> Tony Chu is a cop with a secret. A weirdsecret. Tony Chu is Cibopathic, which means he gets psychic impressions from whatever he eats. It also means he's a hell of a detective, as long as he doesn't mind nibbling on the corpse of a murder victim to figure out whodunit, and why. It`s a dirty job, and Tony has to eat terrible things in the name of justice. And if that wasn`t bad enough, the government has figured out Tony Chu`s secret. They have plans for himâ€¦ whether he likes it or not.  
Presenting a twisted new series about cops, crooks, cooks, cannibals and clairvoyants, written by [JOHN LAYMAN][1](Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness, House of M: Fantastic Four and PUFFED) with mind-blowing art by [ROB GUILLORY][2].

Unlike a lot of comics that are currently running that are continuing stories of super heros we all know and love(I am looking at you X-whatever-marvel-is-currently-doing-to-the-x-men) or trying to reinvigorate a charactor (Batman, Inc. you know who you are); Chew is a completely new. The concept is fresh and a little bit insane. We are talking bat-shit insane, who would have thought cannibalism would make an awesome super power. I certainly didn't.

On top of the awesome story and ideas the art by [ROB GUILLORY][3] is superb. The attention to detail is given to every panel and the way that even the nastiest food is drawn with love is just wonderful to look at. The style of drawing is a perfect fit for the noir detective story that is going on.

And if my review isn't enough to get you pumped and excited then I will play my ace in the hole: Sarah enjoyed reading it. That's right, my wonderful non-comic except for Betty and Veronica reading wife liked the first trade paperback of chew. The third book is supposed to come out on the 24th of November so I would suggest cruising on over to Amazon.com and ordering [Book 1][4] and [Book 2][5]. That way you can read and savor books one and two before book 3 comes out.
