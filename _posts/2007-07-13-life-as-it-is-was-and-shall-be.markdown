<p>I have been working my ass off in this real estate class and find that while some of the material is tricky, the questions that a lot of my classmates ask are quite retarded(no offense to retarded people of course).</p>
<p>I am all for an open forum style classroom with people being able to ask questions about anything covered in class.
