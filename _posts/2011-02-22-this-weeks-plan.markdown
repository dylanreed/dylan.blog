<p>After spending a long weekend relaxing with my wife and resetting my body I came up with some ideas that I am going to pursue over the next couple weeks. Because of this there may be a little less blogging, a little less finished drawing and a lot more work. Here is the order in which I hope to complete things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Script first five pages of "secret comic" (Tuesday Morning)<&#47;li>
<li>Finish up character design for "secret comic" (Wednesday&#47;Thursday)<&#47;li>
<li>Pencil first five pages of "secret comic" (Friday&#47;Saturday)<&#47;li>
<li>Ink first five pages of "secret comic" (Sunday)<&#47;li>
<li>Write next five pages of script of "secret comic" (Following Monday)<&#47;li>
<li>Digitally color first five pages of "secret comic" (Following Tuesday)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br />
I will post sketches etc. as I get them done and maybe even a preview of a cover image mid week. I still plan on drawing daily but they won't be finished drawings but sketches to help me fully develop this idea. Wish me luck.</p>
