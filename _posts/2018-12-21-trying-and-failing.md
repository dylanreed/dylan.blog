In my previous post I said I was working on new writing at that my focus for the rest of 2018 was to write new things. That didn't happen. For a lot of reasons that aren't really important I have fallen out of practice witing. 

When I do sit down to write I feel lost as to what I should be working on. I have a lot of ideas, but I can'r seem to focus on any of them. I bombed NaNoWriMo the past two years because I can't pick a story to focus on. 

I don't have any idea how to fix this, I just have to keep trying and know that failure is part of the process. Reviewing my writing plan that I set up a year ago I found a well thought out plan for a year of productive writing. I just have to do it. 

That is what I am hoping to do in 2019: Focus on the plan and produce work. 

I did some reflecting on my two sucessful NaNo years, which were my two most productive writing years and here the biggest change was my job and Sarah's job. 

Previous to my current job I was able to carve out time to write during the day and didn't have the same emotional stress in my job. Being emotionally drained at the end of the day makes it hard for me to pour my emotions into a story. 

Previous to Sarah's current job, she would leave the house at ungodly hours in the morning, leaving me with an hour before I even had to think about getting ready. I love the time I have with Sarah, and trading that writing time to spend more time with her is a no brainer.

As every article, book, or post about writing says: it is up to me to make time to write. That is what I need to do. Figure out a time everyday that I can sit down and write. This will force me to get back into practice and increase my output. 

The one positive from this last year for my writing is that I have read a lot of new books, writing by a pretty diverse group of people, which will make my fiction stronger. 

Stay tuned for more writing.
