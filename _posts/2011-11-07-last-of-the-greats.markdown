You may remember my post about [Horror Comics and Echoes][1]... you may not... the Dude who wrote Echoes, Mr. Joshua Hale Fialkov has done it again. Last of the Greats is a fantastic look at superheros. Fialkov takes the ideal superheros that came to earth to save us and shows how humans would turn against them. Not only that but he has done it in a way that is fresh. This isn't Irredeemable or Invincible, in fact it doesn't even start with an 'I'. A nice thing about Last of the Greats is that it is a new series, which means if you start reading now you can keep up and not fall behind. Issue two came out last week and you can read both of them at Graphicly.
