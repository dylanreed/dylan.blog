  Emoticons rock. So I am back to school today, and what a fun day it is. Today so far I have learned about learning, specifically language. I found out today that if you are a taught a second language between the ages of 0 and 7 years you will rock at both that language and your natural language. This includes sign language. I wish I would have learned a second language when I was young. Especially since studies by Newport have shown a link to better school performance and those who learn a second language when they are young. Isn't it great how psychollogy lets you blame everything on when you where younger and therefore on you parents. Maybe if I had learned another language when I was young I wouldn't have to use spell check when ever I do an entry.
