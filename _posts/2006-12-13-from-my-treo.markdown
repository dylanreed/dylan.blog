<p>So I am posting this from my treo so my normal hardcore use of spelling etc will be suspended tell next post. I find the little keyboard on the treo to be ok but at the same time annoying. I mean where is the comma? Also it seems odd to me that it knows to automatically capitalize letters after a period but dosen't do it after a question mark. One thing I do like is always being connected to work. that is awesome. really it rules. not even kidding. oh and you might have noticed that it dosen't really capitalize automatically like I originally thought.</p>
<p>On to other things we have the company xmas party tonight and I think that it should be a good time. I am amazed that almost everyone is coming</p>
