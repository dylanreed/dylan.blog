So now i am 22 years old; an old man, or whatever. I had a good birthday as far as it went it was good. today sarah and i are going to go to a movie and that should be fun and then tommarrow we are going to a ballet. its great. This lst week at work i worked only 27 hours in 2 days and that was about all the working i did. it was interesting and fun because i got to work in an oil refinery and get all covered in oil. woohoo!! it was so exciting. this next week i going to be crazy with lots of hours working i hope
