<p>So I spent a little time today updating <a href="http://www.photodork.org">Sarah's blog</a> with a new theme with sidebars and am trying to get Sarah to use categories. After a bad start with a theme that was messy and as my <a href="http://www.nata2.org">brother</a> put it: "MY EYES", I was off to a much better start. I made the header using a picture of a road and a picture of Reno that I had removed the background from, I also modified the CSS of the theme to fit my needs a little better.</p>
<p>I then set up the ads and the sidebar as well as some categories, now I just need to get Sarah to update a lot. We shall see. Oh I also took this sweet picture:</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is a picture of a hearse with BTK on the back. I love serial killer fans.</p>
