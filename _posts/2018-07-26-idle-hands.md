This blog has existed for almost 6000 days and I have written 716 posts. Doing the math shows that I have posted a blog almost every week for sixteen years and five months. 

Granted, there have been times when I haven't posted for months at a time, but there have been times when I have posted daily. It all evens out. 

When I was first looking at the numbers I was shocked that I averaged one post every eight days. I assumed that it would be one a month or every two weeks. Apparently I am cooler than I thought.

What I have been upto since December 2017 

* Working a lot
* Reading a lot
* Writing some
* Playing a lot of idle games
* Role Playing Games
* Thinking about things

About a year ago I changed jobs. I went from a very negative, almost hostile, work environment to a place that values me for who I am. And I love it. 

It isn't just that I am suported at work, it is that I love what I do. I spend my days talking about death and dying. It is amazing. 

Last year I planned out the books I was going to read and this year I have just been reading what interests me. And it has gone a lot better. Part of my reading this year has been focused on the craft of writing.

I haven't been writing as regularly as I would like. Part of this was because I was brain dead when I got home, part of it was stress related, and part was because I got lazy and fell out of practice. 

Idle games are my newest crack. They are great time wasters and they give me a break when I have a moment in my day. I will probably be writing about them more in the future. 

My friend Jon and I have been experimenting with tabletop RPGs over the internet. Since Jon moved to Steamboat I haven't had a steady game and it has been nice to be able to do some collaborative story telling with a friend. Also of note: STARFINDER IS FANTASTIC!! 

I have been exploring meditation as a way of coping with the heavy emotional burden my job can place on me. Sitting still is hard, but it has been worth it for the peace of mind I have.
