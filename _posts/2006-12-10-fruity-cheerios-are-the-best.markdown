<p>This morning I awoke to one of the best morning sounds. Sarah Making waffles. I quickly got out of bed and eat me some delicious waffle. THen sarah had to go so she could go play in blackhawk with her mom and aunt carol. I took a quick shower, finished the Subtle Knife and waited for my cousins to come over.</p>
<p>Once they arrived we played mario party 7 briefly and then headed to the pool. The kids swam around and I threw snowballs at them. After they where done swimming we headed home and waited for my mom. Once she arrived we went to TGI fridays to get some lunch.</p>
<p>After lunch I left them and went to get my haircut(i am sexy) and then to cingular to cancel our new phones(cause they suck). After that I headed home took a brief nap and then started to get ready for my clown job.</p>
<p>At first I couldn't find my makeup. That Equals major-panic, mostly because as funny looking as I am, I do not look like a clown. So I ran around like a crazy until I found it. Stupid closets hiding my makeup from me. By the time I found it I had about 20 minutes to get ready (it normally takes me 30-45 minutes to get it on).</p>
<p>After I got ready I headed to Eaton to rock the towns Christmas Festival. I spent an hour and a holf doing ballons in the cafeteria of the High School and then moved my operation downtown. I walked around, doing card tricks and the like, until I realized that itwas wicked damn cold outside.</p>
<p>So I started to go into the businesses and get hot apple cider. THey all had free hot apple cider, so I would do a trick and then get some cider and the move on. One interesting thing I ofund out is that eaton has a really good sized used book store.</p>
<p>Once I was done clowning around I headed home. More exactly I headed to my parents house since sarah wasn't home yet. I watched most of fly away home and then headed to my house where I took off my makeup, talk to harper on the internet and ate fruity cherrios for dinner</p>
<p>Boy are they good</p>
