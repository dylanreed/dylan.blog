So today started off sad with Sarah being all riled up about being sick. She is Sick and Damn Tired of being sick. I agree with her assesment of the being sick. After that I haeaded to FOCO to do my duties at work. While at work I enjoyed watching the hunt for red october while I did paper work.

I also made a nice entry at clownsareawesome last night, however it appears to be broke right now
