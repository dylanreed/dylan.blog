So having started the store I wanted to get some opinions as well as spread the word about the store. I have just started using [Consummating.com][1] and it seem like a good place to get an opinion since it was my first post of any sort.

I have gotten some interesting feedback so far but I don't know what to do. The most helpful comment was that I needed to include dimensions and care instructions for the purses, which got me thinking about including a size chart for the hoodies. The most confusing comment has been about the front page. Should it be a paragraph explaining stuff with links interspersed to help with navigation or should the products be big links of their own to blast people with where the stuff can be found.

I personally think that having the links in the sentence leads people to the place they need to get and overstating them makes it look crappy. I changed it to the list of items to see what the people who have commented think so we shall see. Let me know what you think. 

Oh and for the [cuteness.][2]
