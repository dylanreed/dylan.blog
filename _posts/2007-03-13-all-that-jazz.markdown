<p>So having started the store I wanted to get some opinions as well as spread the word about the store. I have just started using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.consumating.com&#47;profiles&#47;awesomeguy&#47;invite?v=1173823030_ea99b1992c2cda886a3163af3de7a960">Consummating.com<&#47;a> and it seem like a good place to get an opinion since it was my first post of any sort. <&#47;p>
<p>I have gotten some interesting feedback so far but I don't know what to do. The most helpful comment was that I needed to include dimensions and care instructions for the purses, which got me thinking about including a size chart for the hoodies. The most confusing comment has been about the front page. Should it be a paragraph explaining stuff with links interspersed to help with navigation or should the products be big links of their own to blast people with where the stuff can be found.<&#47;p>
<p>I personally think that having the links in the sentence leads people to the place they need to get and overstating them makes it look crappy. I changed it to the list of items to see what the people who have commented think so we shall see. Let me know what you think. <&#47;p>
<p>Oh and for the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.threadless.com&#47;profile&#47;174696&#47;reallyreallyawesomeguy&#47;blog&#47;200427&#47;Busted">cuteness.<&#47;a><&#47;p></p>
