<p>But we'll get to that later.</p>
<p>I have once again re-designed dylanreed.com. You may have noticed. I scanned all of the "notes" I have taken this semester and made them into a digital collage to use as a background. All of the papers were from legal pads and I had quite a bit of fun. I also really liked the king-parrot doodle I did, so I made him larger then the rest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately&nbsp;due to credit card companies being butt-heads and myself not making enough money I am taking a year off from school. I am currently looking for work and also trying to make money in unusual ways. As these things come around I will try to post what they are here, though it might just be easier to follow me on&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;awesomeguy">twitter<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>This semester has been quite a bit of fun. I will do a longer post later, but for now I have to say that I have found drawing to be a lot of fun. I enjoy mark making as you might be able to tell from my new design and this drawing class might as well be a sculpture class with my last&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;dylansarah&#47;5144511904&#47;">project<&#47;a>. To add to the awesomeness that has been this semester we have to talk about metalsmithing. Metals is both the most frustrating and the most rewarding art class I have taken. I have spent time pulling my hair out, hinges I am looking at you, and I have spent time jumping for joy, like when I pulled a certain sheep(I forgot to take an after shot so here is&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;dylansarah&#47;5125999404&#47;">before<&#47;a>) out of the tumbler.</p>
<p>I am attempting to give up the slurpees as they have become a gateway to soda drinking, which is a place I do not want to return. As such I am hoping that anyone who is sad that they didn't buy me a soda can go ahead and buy me a comic book. As little as&nbsp;<a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.paypal.com&#47;us&#47;cgi-bin&#47;webscr?cmd=_flow&amp;SESSION=bM9D5RY98TsLVwj6SHTlDms6fW1aU7YIvXH6gscHYaS-UJzLtUXuJ-pd1YW&amp;dispatch=50a222a57771920b6a3d7b606239e4d529b525e0b7e69bf0224adecfb0124e9b61f737ba21b08198aa166382b1a4fa18dd0806b806506d52">$3.29<&#47;a> will buy one comic book and I will do my best to get better at the thanking... maybe a cover shot of the comic you&nbsp;sponsored.</p>
<p>Well, here it is the teleporter talk. Thanks for waiting. In October Sarah and I went to Chicago to hang out with Harper and Hiromi. It was a load of fun and I got to meet a lot of neat people.&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;all of these people live in Chicago, so I rarely get to see them anywhere but on the internet. We met Scott, Moshe, Freedom Dylan (more on that later), Sarah and a bunch of other people who were a lot of fun to hang out with. We&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=wv5DdGSwimc&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">juggled<&#47;a>(Rated R for language), I made horrible jokes and read some poor kids mind in Wicker Park.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with a teleporter? I think that it would be fantastic if I could see these people whenever I wanter. Just pop into Chicago say hi and be home for dessert. It would be a lot more convenient then having to get on a plane to head that direction. Sarah and I have talked about moving that direction but alas that takes money and jobs and the like and we are running low on those at the&nbsp;moment. We will be there for X-mas so maybe we can see some of these people again.</p>
<p>That is all for the moment. There is a new feature in comments that lets you choose you avatar, check it out, use it, let's see if it works. Hopefully I can update more in the future. Oh... if you have a job for someone who is awesome at a lot of stuff, hit me up ASAP.</p>
