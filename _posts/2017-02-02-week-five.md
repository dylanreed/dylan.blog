A little late but who cares!!!

This week was an interesting mix of trying to unclog my emotional blockage from my dad getting sick and work being insane. I had a rough time on Friday, everything came to a head, and I am lucky that my coworker is awesome and puts up with my nonsense. Also, thanks to Snapchat for having so many filters with funny voices, it helps.

Tuesday I had therapy, which is the best thing I could have done. We talked about a lot of things and, other than draining me emotionally, it was what I needed to have happen. 

Wednesday my dad made it home. Wound vac, gloves and weird cushions galore, but he is home and doing well. Which is a weight off of my mind. I hate hospitals and I think that having my dad home will help me chill out. 

See you next week.
