tomarrow is the day of the channel crossing. hopefully. i am very excited for scott and the whole kronus team. scott is going to be underwater for 10 hours and travel at least 30 miles. the sub is frickin awesome. i am now a cockpit ergonomics designer. basically that means i put all the ball valves in places that were easy to reach and the hoses do not interfere with general operations of the sub. i also got pizza. it was good. i was at scotts for a long time today and another long day tomarrow. everyone have a nice day.

love to all
