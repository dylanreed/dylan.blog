<p>hello all </p>
<p>sorry it has been so long since i have writen. i am having a good time but am very tired and so i am lazy. i have been spending most of my time workin and going to school. it has been fun. on sun i worked 16.25 hours at hollywood. don't do that ever. granted i made over 130 dollers that day but still it kindof sucked. at school we have a final and it is going to be so easy. i am going to get at least and 88% so that should be fun. I am almost done and will have to move home soon. YIPEE. i am so excited. i can not wait. this weeks movie realeases are scooby doo and enough with j-lo. spider man on vid comes out nov 1st that is all</p>
<p>love you guts especially sarah. byby</p>
