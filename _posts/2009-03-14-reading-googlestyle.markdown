<p><span>Harper has been trying to get me to use Google reader for some time. Mostly because he thinks it is awesome. Well, Harper, I am sorry to say that you were right. It is awesome. I love the way it compiles all of the things I used to have to cruise around to get. I also enjoy finding new things, like soap, within the feeds.</span></p>
<p><span>I have been using it for about two weeks now and am really starting to enjoy it. The funniest thing is how adverse I was to using it. Harper would tell me I should use it and I would fight him and fight him. Now that I have used it I am a big fan, I even try to get other people to use it. The only problem is that I spend more time on Google Reader then anywhere else.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This isn&rsquo;t that conducive to getting a lot of work done. I mean, sure, I am not spending my time wondering the internet; instead I spend my time having the internet delivered to my computer. This is great. It is like having a newspaper that carries news I care about delivered three to one hundred times a day.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So if there is someone in your life that has suggested that you try Google Reader, listen to them. I wish I would have sooner.</p></p>
