  content: I have never had that problem. Are you able to use the 2nd controller on
    other games. If not you will need to sync it with the wii. If so I would change
    the batteries and try again or switch which wii-mote is 2nd player.

  content: Yeah I was able to use the 2nd controller with other games... only had
    the issue with cooking mama. No problem, i'll keep trying (to figure out the issue)...
    In the meantime, i'll have fun with the one player mode :) Cheers and thanks for
    your reply!

  content: "No problem. I found this on <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;ph.answers.yahoo.com&#47;question&#47;index?qid=20070418122729AA2Hbaz&show=7\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">yahoo answers<&#47;a>.\r\n\r\nAre you able to get into the game,
    it is just that you cannot use the second player wii-mote to select options. Apparently
    if both players could select options it would confuse the system so they disable
    it until you get to the playing area.\r\n\r\nHope this works."

  content: "hi Dylan, thanks for researching into this. I was looking up on some forums
    yesterday as well. Someone had the same problem, and apparently we have to hit
    the  button, go back to remote settings, disconnect P1, and reconnect P1 and P2
    together. I tried it and it's good! (very happy)... and what u pointed out above
    is true as well, we can't use the 2nd mote to select options and it appears only
    when the cooking starts. \n\nThanks again :) and have fun on dive trips! read
    some of your diving blogs too... cheers!"

<p>I sent Cooking Mama back today, or I will tomorrow, and I had a fun last couple of hours playing on it. I discovered some parts of the game that more then made up for a lot of the problems I mentioned in my earlier posts.</p>
<p>I discovered the Cookoff section that allows you to compete against your cooking friends to win stuff for your kitchen. I found that to be quite fun as well as adding to the addiction. I also was able to compensate for th control issues that I found annoying, I am now able to cook like a bad ass.</p>
