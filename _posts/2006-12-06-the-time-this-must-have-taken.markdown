<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=Kw1itGshvD4">This<&#47;a> is the greatest light xmas decorations ever. I wish I had the time and dedication to do something like that. I think that harper and I need to do something like that to my mom and dad's house next year. Their neighbors would love that.</p>
<p>I think that video helped me get into the xmas spirit finally. All my troubles have melted away to be replaced by happy feelings.</p>
<p>On a less happy note, apparently people went <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.greeleytrib.com&#47;article&#47;20061206&#47;NEWS&#47;112060057">crazy<&#47;a> in Greeley again. It almost like we are a big city. From the looks of the article we even had a chase before he barricaded himself inside the apartments. The funny but not funny part is he was supposedly going to kill himself but the greeley cops got there first. So now his family is all pissed off blaming the greeley cops for his death and all that.</p>
<p>GO GREELEY!</p>
