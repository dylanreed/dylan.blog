He dances and dances, wooing the ladies and charming the guys. He never fights or bad mouths anyone, he just spends his time looking cool. Of course it wasn't always like that...</p>

It rules.<a href="http://awesomeguy.etsy.com" target="_blank"><img height="89" src="http://images.etsy.com/all_images/4/4e2/121/il_430xN.18045869.jpg" width="134" align="left"/></a></p><br />
