<p>Well after having a nice weekend long pity party I have a plan.</p>
<p>Step one: Stop Paying the bills,</p>
<p>Step two: Tell bill collectors that they suck</p>
<p>Step Three: Lose everything</p>
<p>Thats it, the plan.</p>
<p>Actually Sarah and I have decided that we will probably be ok it will just be crappy for a little while. On the plus side today is payday so I get to go get my pay check and sign it over to wells fargo with an extra dollar attached. Man I hate those guys.</p>
<p>It looks like Sarah's mom and dad will be helping us out a little. Helping us pay down some of our higher interest rate stuff, and then paying them back. I guess I could ask my parents but I hate talking money with them. I mean hate a lot. I would rather fight an armored bear from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/His-Dark-Materials-Trilogy-Spyglass/dp/0440419514/sr=8-1/qid=1165338397/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-8356827-0138522?ie=UTF8&s=books">His Dark Materials</a>(which you should all read) then talk to them about money</p>
<p>So basically the plan is. Get money where we can. Pay money to the people the need it. get buffalo wings when we can afford it. Oh and sell the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylansarah/310404965/">ginger</a> for a 99.99\lbs. That will help</p>
<p>For anyone wanting to make donations to the cause, we will be holdinh a vitual bake sell over the next couple weeks. If you donate $5 we will send you a picture of a brownie or Cinnimon roll, $10 a picture of a piece of cake or a 7 layer bar. Now for $25 we will send you an actual cinnimon roll, you just pay the shipping.</p>
<p>Questions email me.</p>
