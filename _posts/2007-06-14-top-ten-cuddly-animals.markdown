I have recently noticed a lot of of propagand put out by the lovers of Killer Whales. These pictures show Shamu or one of his Killer Brethren usually with a person or little kid. I think that the idea behind these photos is to make people think that these huge meat eating mammels are cuddly. So to clear the air I thought I would put together a list of animals that are in fact quite cuddly.

You might notice that Killer Whales are no where on this list. Think about it.
