  content: "Awesome.\r\nMy name is Cameron. I was the one that suggested the link
    for the Kitty Cot to Make. \r\n\r\nI thought I would just say that you did an
    awesome job. How much did it end up costing you to make in the end?  I am glad
    someone re-made the product ($50 buck seems a bit steep for my tastes). I need
    to get around to make one for my cat."

  content: "I didn't even think about including cost in my post. Since I can't find
    the receipt I have given my best guess.Here you go:\r\nSuction Cups: Four 20lbs
    Wreath Hangers- $2.49 each\r\n                    10' 3/4\" PVC pipe(of which
    I used 80\")- $2.15\r\n                    250' Spool of twine(of which I used
    100\")- $2.50\r\n                    Fabric- Free, it was just hanging around
    my house\r\n                    Elbows, etc.- $.95ish each\r\n\r\nTotal: Around
    $20 if you have to buy the fabric."

<p>Inspired by<a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/05/kitty_cot_window_cat_perch.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890"> MAKE magazine</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Made in one afternoon. PVC, Fabric, twine(which may be switched to wire), suction cups and a curious fat cat. He weighs in around 16 lbs and is&nbsp;good to go.</p>
<p><object width="437" height="370" data="http://www.viddler.com/player/b04ae0c9/" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="id" value="viddler_CaptainAwesome_11" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/b04ae0c9/" /><param name="name" value="viddler_CaptainAwesome_11" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>Things to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stronger fabric that has a little less give</li>
<li>Metal wire instead of twine</li><br />
</ul></p>
