  content: "Awesome.\r\nMy name is Cameron. I was the one that suggested the link
    for the Kitty Cot to Make. \r\n\r\nI thought I would just say that you did an
    awesome job. How much did it end up costing you to make in the end?  I am glad
    someone re-made the product ($50 buck seems a bit steep for my tastes). I need
    to get around to make one for my cat."

  content: "I didn't even think about including cost in my post. Since I can't find
    the receipt I have given my best guess.Here you go:\r\nSuction Cups: Four 20lbs
    Wreath Hangers- $2.49 each\r\n                    10' 3&#47;4\" PVC pipe(of which
    I used 80\")- $2.15\r\n                    250' Spool of twine(of which I used
    100\")- $2.50\r\n                    Fabric- Free, it was just hanging around
    my house\r\n                    Elbows, etc.- $.95ish each\r\n\r\nTotal: Around
    $20 if you have to buy the fabric."

<p>Inspired by<a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.makezine.com&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;05&#47;kitty_cot_window_cat_perch.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890"> MAKE magazine<&#47;a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Made in one afternoon. PVC, Fabric, twine(which may be switched to wire), suction cups and a curious fat cat. He weighs in around 16 lbs and is&nbsp;good to go.</p>
<p><object width="437" height="370" data="http:&#47;&#47;www.viddler.com&#47;player&#47;b04ae0c9&#47;" type="application&#47;x-shockwave-flash"><param name="id" value="viddler_CaptainAwesome_11" &#47;><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" &#47;><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" &#47;><param name="src" value="http:&#47;&#47;www.viddler.com&#47;player&#47;b04ae0c9&#47;" &#47;><param name="name" value="viddler_CaptainAwesome_11" &#47;><param name="wmode" value="transparent" &#47;><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" &#47;><&#47;object></p>
<p>Things to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stronger fabric that has a little less give<&#47;li>
<li>Metal wire instead of twine<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
