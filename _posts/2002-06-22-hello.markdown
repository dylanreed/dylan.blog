  content: I don't appreciate you making fun of my friend on you web page.  You can't
    smell her through the computer.  You don't know her- personally.  Anyway, we really
    enjoy your stories.  We also enjoy the stories Sarah shares with us about you.  We
    also would like more pictures on your page.
