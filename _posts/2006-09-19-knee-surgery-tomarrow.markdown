<p>So i get to get cut up tomarrow and I am so excited. I am going to have knee surgery on the left knee. Hopefully when it is all said and done I will have un crooked knees.</p>
<p>Three weeks after this surgery I will get the other one worked on to do the same thing on the right.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Surgery is at 11am, wish me luck</p>
