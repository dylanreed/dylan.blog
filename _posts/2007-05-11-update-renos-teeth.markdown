<p>Update: Reno had his teeth removed and is doing great. He was a little out of it last night but was back to his piggish self early this morning. He had 16 teeth pulled and has 14 left. The amazing thing is that it hasn't affected his appetite at all, he still steals all of the other cats food.</p>
<p>Total cost: $771.34</p>
<p>Hopefully we won't have to deal with this again with another cat and also hopefully Reno will stay healthy and not have to lose anymore teeth.</p>
