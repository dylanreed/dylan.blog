  * It has been a very ministry Monday morning [#][1]
  * Thanks @[reedmorebooks][2] For my parking permit, less running around makes school more fun. That and music [in reply to reedmorebooks][3] [#][4]
  * So my dad does not have blood cancer. Go him! [#][5]
  * Today's highlights: picked up a faith healing south African hitchhikers, started my sculpture, don't have very much homework and it's noon. [#][6]
  * Sleepy but ready for work, wish my neck wasn't sore [#][7]
  * Sarah and I have been married for five years, go us. [#][8]
