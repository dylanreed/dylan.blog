<p>I guess I may be a little late on this. Whatever.</p>
<p>Things that have happened so far this year. I was laid off by Graphicly because they no longer need an android tester(what?). At least that is what I was told. I looked for a job. For about 4 weeks solid I hammered the internet pavement and the real world pavement looking for a job. I found none. Apparently the job market sucks.</p>
<p>Luckily my dad always needs help. And even though I am pretty sure I said I would never go back to that place I have been enjoying it quite a bit. I think that I have grown quite a bit as an employee and so it should go better.</p>
<p>I have been clowning a little bit more then normal for this time of year. Not a lot more... but a little more. I was lucky enough to see Eugene Burger at a conference I attended with Harper. It was amazing. He does things with cards that I only dream about. The best part about it was that I am now inspired to start being more hardcore with the magic.</p>
<p>I went to Sun Valley Utah(actually Idaho but I was told it was Utah leading up to the trip) for Dent(This would be the conference referenced in the last paragraph). Harper was speaking there and he had a +1 so I joined him. It was a good time. I will post more about the fun that was the conference later.</p>
<p>In other news I&nbsp;received&nbsp;a Wii U from my parents, harper and Sarah for my birthday. I love it. Sarah and I have been playing the shit out of some Mario. I love being able to help Sarah with the platforming without being in the way like on the other&nbsp;Mario&nbsp;coop titles. I have been playing Black Ops 2 and Lego City Undercover(forever&nbsp;referred&nbsp;to as GTA:Lego). I think that Nintendo created a wonderful product that once again is pushing what a console should do. I am not sure it is as groundbreaking as motion control was but I think it adds to gaming in a positive way.</p>
<p>Now that I have a normal job I hope to rock out some new projects and finish up some older projects. Check back for a post on that as well.</p>
<p>Thats what I have been doing for the last couple months.</p>
