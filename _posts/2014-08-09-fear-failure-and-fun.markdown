<p>I wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L9MCJHK">book</a>.</p>
<p>It started out as a blog post. 1000 words about dealing with fear and failure using fun. I shared it with Harper and he encouraged me to write an e-book. So I did.</p>
<p>Since I have a full time job I wrote a lot of the book in short spurts. When I was on a computer I used <a href="http://www.draftin.com">draft</a>. Draft is a great online word processor made only for writing. It is fantastic. I recommend it to anyone who needs an online writing solution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don't spend that much time in front of a computer. I spend most of my time in a car waiting for people to show up for appointments. I needed a way to write in my car. A laptop would have been ideal. I have a mac mini at home and that is not super portable. Sarah has a laptop but I didn't want to steal it from her.</p>
<p>I do have an iPad though. After much researching I found a nice keyboard that converts the iPad into a basic laptop. I wrote 3/4 of this book on that. I was quite happy with the way it all worked together. I would write in pages on the ipad, save to iCloud and then copy paste into Draft. That allowed me to use Drafts built in editors to help me write better.</p>
<p>The other tool I found useful was <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a>. This app is great because it helps you simplify your writing in a non-destructive way. It highlights sections that are troublesome and then unhighlights them once you fix them. Really helps getting rid of passive voice in writing.</p>
<p>With all of these tools I was able to get the book finished. Harper helped me with getting it all set up with Amazon. It has been live for just over a month. Feel free to check it out:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L9MCJHK">The Three Fs: Using fun to overcome fear and failure</a>.</p>
