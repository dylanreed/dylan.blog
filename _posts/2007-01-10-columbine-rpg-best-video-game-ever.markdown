<p>So recently a new role playing game has been released for the PC. It is the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.columbinegame.com&#47;">Super Columbine Massacre RPG<&#47;a>. I applaud the creator for putting forth his take on the events as well as taking the time to research what happened. I would say that a lot of people misunderstand the purpose of the game and I think that that is sad.</p>
<p>A lot of people are quite upset about the game. While I can see why this game would offend people directly involved in the shooting, I think that those people's anger could be better aimed at games that don't have a message within their violence. The games creator had this to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.washingtonpost.com&#47;wp-dyn&#47;content&#47;article&#47;2006&#47;05&#47;19&#47;AR2006051901979.html">say<&#47;a>:</p>
<p>"I'm not advocating shooting up your school, and I don't know how many times I can say that and no one will listen. This game does not glorify school shootings. If you make it far enough in the game, you see very graphic photos of Eric and Dylan lying dead." Ledonne said. "I can't think of a more effective way to confront their actions and the consequences those actions had."</p>
<p>I think that it is a possibility that this was the author of the games outlet about school violence. I think that people could learn a lot from this game and the violent, graphic pictures at the end of the game would make people think twice about destroying their school and their life.</p>
