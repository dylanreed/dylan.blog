At work we have recently been placing all of our vacant properties on to the local craigslist. At first I was skeptical since I have never really used craigslist for anything, and we are so used to paying for advertising that it is crazy. 

So over the last week 1\4 of our site traffic has been from craigslist. So it works. If you doubted it, people look at craigslist. I may be able to sell my scooter if I put it up...Awesome.
