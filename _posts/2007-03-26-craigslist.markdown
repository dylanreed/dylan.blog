<p>At work we have recently been placing all of our vacant properties on to the local craigslist. At first I was skeptical since I have never really used craigslist for anything, and we are so used to paying for advertising that it is crazy. </p>
<p>So over the last week 1\4 of our site traffic has been from craigslist. So it works. If you doubted it, people look at craigslist. I may be able to sell my scooter if I put it up...Awesome.</p></p>
