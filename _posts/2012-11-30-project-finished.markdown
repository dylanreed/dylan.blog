<p>I finally finished building a foam puppet... It only took &nbsp;me a couple years to get it done. Now I want to build another one with what I learned from this one. It is quite a bit of fun and not that difficult if you aren't afraid to do a little experimenting.</p>
<p><a style="color: #1f536c; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;" href="http://www.dylanreed.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/photo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-1593" title="Puppet" src="http://www.dylanreed.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/photo-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Things I would change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make him bigger. My hand/arm barely fit.</li>
<li>Do something different with the eyes. Like sink them into the skull a little bit. Also better pupils</li>
<li>I had a really hard time with the mouth. But I figured out the best way to do it... I think</li>
<li>Add a&nbsp;tongue. All that red is crazy.</li>
<li>Arm rods</li>
<li>Hand sew the whole thing, because I am just that hardcore.</li>
<li>Try and get away from the knock off muppet look.</li><br />
</ul><br />
I'll try again soon. May need to get some more foam. I was mostly just winging it this time and so I used stuff I had lying around. I want to do a little more planning next time and build an awesome puppet.</p>
