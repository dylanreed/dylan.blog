    omg john stevens should have been cut a long time ago.  please do not tell me you like him.  he may have a good voice but he is no american idol.  jpl was much better.  i hope fantasia wins.

<p>If for no other reason then that I do ballet.</p>
<p>To day was the big kickoff for summer at work, it ruled cause it was cold and not summery outside. I am sleepy now, all I want is to take a nap, or maybe read a book, or maybe both.</p>
<p>So the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.starbucks.com">Store<&#47;a> i am currently working at is a drive through store. The greatest part is when you have to ask someone to repeat something. so they repeat it louder and slower. its just like how people will talk to someone who dosen't know english. I---NEED---A---VENTI---HAZLE---NUT---LATTE. Or another fun thing is when you tell someone that you'll be right with them and they go ahead and order anyway. that i think is the best.</p>
<p>In other news.</p>
<p>HELLBOY wasn't as awesome as it should have been, HULK on the other hand was the coolest movie I have seen in a while, however the most interesting movie I have seen recently has to have been KILL BILL. good time good times</p>
<p>Oh and thy was JPL cut from american idol, he may not be a john stevens or a fantasia but come on the boy could sing.</p>
<p>(sorry about that harper please don't take away my blog)</p>
