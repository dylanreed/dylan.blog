<p>So I am starting to get back into clowning. I kind of stepped away from it for a while. I think that was mostly because i was in california and was really lazy. I have started once again to design a costume through <a href="http://www.mooseburger.com">pricilla mooseburger</a>, however, I will most likely have my mom's seamstrss friend make it. I am also going to try to get some <a href="http://www.spearshoes.com">professional</a> <a href="http://www.jollywalkers.com">clown</a> <a href="http://www.clownsoport.com">shoes</a>. Hopefully they will be the last pair i have to by for the next 6 or 7 years. I am thinking also of getting a new wig. I would like to get one made of yak hair becasue it is more realistic but alas I am having a hard time finding a yak wig. The great thing about yak wigs is you can style them just like real hair and dye them also. I am getting a new <a href="http://www.proknows.com">clown nose</a>It will most likely be the SC a medium nose that has an interesting shape. I might also get the TXL. I will probably keep the same makeup as before because it fits my face but i may try to design a tramp charector as well.<br />
Another thing i am think about doing is starting a non-profit hospital clowning service working through banner health. I think that starbucks may give me the money i need to start it but we'll hav to see. I hope i can find donation from other places as well. I figure i need like 2000 to start it up for supplies and also for a little more training. Ideally i would like to be able to liveoff of donations from hospital clowning. I feel that hospital clowns are needed in every hospital to bring all of the sick and injured a little bit of laughter. laughter may not be the best medicine but it sure helps.<br />
On a much more fun note my dad gets to have open heart surgery. go dad. it appears that one of his heart valves is missing a leaflet so it is leaky. the funniest part is that it has nothing to do with smoking or drinking so go dad.<br />
thanksgiving was this last weekend and fun was had by all. lots of juggling was done and I did some crazy eating of the apple. I alsoworkied with my spinning plate. I have finished my design for a balloon sniches the dr suess charectors where some have stars upon thars and some don't. a great story with mr mcmonkeymcbean. you know that one. I have also perfected some of my unicycling. I am hoping to put together a one clown stage show by march and to go to moosecamp this year.<br />
thats all.<br />
sarah with majesty I LOVE YOU.</p>
