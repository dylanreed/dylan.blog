It is cold today. Really cold. According to my phone (which is an iphone so it has to be correct) it is -40 with windchill in Greeley today. WTF. That is stupid cold. I am not a fan.

Here is the deal though. I have a house, food and a car. I am super lucky. I was whining to myself about the fact that my car's heater was slow at getting warm. Then I drove by a dude digging through a dumpster for food. Made me feel like a super big douchebag.

Please keep this in mind when you are dealing with the cold. Not everyone is lucky enough to have heat, a bed or even a coat. If you are able to please help people out. Have an old coat? donate it to a homeless shelter. Have some extra money? Give it to those that need it.

It is really easy to look past the homeless and poor but it is important to provide support for those that need it. Don't assume that someone else will help, because that someone else is assuming you will help.

The nice thing about helping others is that you feel good afterwards. Even something as simple as giving someone all your change will make you feel better the rest of the day and potentially help them make it through another day.

When I worked for graphicly I would see the same dude every week as I left town. I started giving him all the change in my slurpee fund. I also started to buy an extra cupcake when I went to Tee and Cakes for Sarah and I. He would get that extra cupcake.

As time went on I noticed that he was wearing nicer clothes. Not a suit or anything but he was wearing cleaner clothes. One day he had a decent backpack and water bottle. I don't know where he got all of these things but I know that he was helped through the generosity of others.

After I got laid off from graphicly I always wondered what happened to him. I hope that he continued to get the help he needed to get on his feet.
