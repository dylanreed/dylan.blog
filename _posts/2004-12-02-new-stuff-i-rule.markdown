<p>So I am awesome. I had Knee surgery and was fully recovered in about a week. Unfortunatly I neglected to milk the "pain" for all it was worth. I did however discoever the Codine sux. It makes me all itchy. </p>
<p>I am currently working on a new clown look\act etc. I had an idea of the way I wanted it to look and after consulting with some other clowns I might change some things and revery a little back to the old clown while continuing forward in my development.</p>
<p>I am sleepy.</p>
<p>Sarah's BFA show opening is Thursday December at 6pm at the Tointin Gallery in Greeley Colorado</p>
