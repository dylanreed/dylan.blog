I posted last [week][1] with a list of all of my big plans and how excited I was to work on them. Unfortunately it was a shitty week, Sarah's mom had to put a cat to sleep, my mom faked a heart attack(not really but she had some chest pains and everything turned out ok) and on top of all that I am being skull fucked by my sinuses. It is a bunch of crap. So in lieu of not posting anything I will just give you an update. I am still sick. I don't like it and I hope to feel better and start work on my secret project soon. That is all
