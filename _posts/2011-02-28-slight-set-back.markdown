<p>I posted last <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanreed.com&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;22&#47;this-weeks-plan&#47;">week<&#47;a> with a list of all of my big plans and how excited I was to work on them.&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;it was a shitty week, Sarah's mom had to put a cat to sleep, my mom faked a heart attack(not really but she had some chest pains and everything turned out ok) and on top of all that I am being skull fucked by my sinuses. It is a bunch of crap. So in&nbsp;lieu&nbsp;of not posting anything I will just give you an update. I am still sick. I don't like it and I hope to feel better and start work on my secret project soon. That is all</p>
