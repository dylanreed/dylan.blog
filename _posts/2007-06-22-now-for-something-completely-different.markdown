As I stated earlier in this [post][1] I am tired of trying to get my ads figured out. Sarah has told me to suck it up at least until we get to the magic number so I have decided to try a different way to display the ads.

I am trying to do them inside of the post. I think that this will free up a lot of space on my sidebar, as well as hopefully drawing people eyes towards the ads. I realize that these ads could possibly be more annoying, so if that is the case shoot me a comment so that I can kill them ASAP.

One thing that I have found recently is that I have no idea what people want to read about. I seem to get a good response from the Killer Whale articles, though this last batch lead to almost no ad clicks so who knows.

Here goes nothing
