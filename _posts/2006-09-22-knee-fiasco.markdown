So I had surgery yesterday and it all went well until I started to fill like shit yesterday. What happenend is we followed the instructions from the surgery center for my vicodin and It made me crazy nauseous and dizzy so we went to the ER and low and behold i was dehydrated.

So after I got my shit rehydrated and such sarah and I got ready to leave. Since we had valet parked the car they had parked it in god knws where and we couldn't find it. They gave us the keys andpointed "over there" Check sarah's blog for I am sure a more sassy account
