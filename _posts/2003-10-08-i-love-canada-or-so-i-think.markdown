<p>So I had previously typed up this super fly entry. the only problem is that I erased it. Cause I rock. I just got done taking a map test in geography class, I ripped it up pretty good. I really wanted to spell ripped riped, you know like I riped up that banana or riped up that peach. that way things are more edible. my original post was on sign language among <a href="http://www.koko.org">apes</a>. I thought that it would be interesting to teach my cat sign language. here are some excerpts from my journal. <b>MONDAY 10/06/03</b> show Thomas ASL alphabet. He looks at me and then goes and kills furry mouse (note to self:remove mouse from "lab"). <b>LATER SAME DAY</b> Cat now understands no ASL and has only picked up one sign that looks surprisingly like "<i><a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail24.html">the bird</a></i>". Wondering were he could have learned that? <b>THE NEXT DAY</b> I was telling Sarah about my experiment and the shocking results and she said that i was crazy. who'd of thought.</p>
<p>I am getting married in less then a year... GO ME!</p>
