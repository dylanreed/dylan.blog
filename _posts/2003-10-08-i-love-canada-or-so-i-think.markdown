So I had previously typed up this super fly entry. the only problem is that I erased it. Cause I rock. I just got done taking a map test in geography class, I ripped it up pretty good. I really wanted to spell ripped riped, you know like I riped up that banana or riped up that peach. that way things are more edible. my original post was on sign language among [apes][1]. I thought that it would be interesting to teach my cat sign language. here are some excerpts from my journal. **MONDAY 10/06/03** show Thomas ASL alphabet. He looks at me and then goes and kills furry mouse (note to self:remove mouse from "lab"). **LATER SAME DAY** Cat now understands no ASL and has only picked up one sign that looks surprisingly like "_[the bird][2]_". Wondering were he could have learned that? **THE NEXT DAY** I was telling Sarah about my experiment and the shocking results and she said that i was crazy. who'd of thought.
