how are you all doing today. i am ggod except that I was in colorado this weekend and now i am not.it is sad boohoo. anyhoo. I started open tanks today. my teacher is MASTER DIVER Bob Cave. Bob is a really nice man who knows what the f**k he is talking about. Oh and if you say F**k in front of him you have to do 20 pushups. its funny. This class is about diving mechanics and practical aplication of our knowledge gained thus far. I think it is interesting because it means in 3 more class days i'll be getting in the water. it is so cool. my phone is starting to die. the battery charge is only holding for about 1 hour now it sux. i am looking at new phones but they cost money so please pay pal me money. harper can you set up paypal on my sight so people can donate me money for a new phone thanx. any way. you guys should all have a good couple of days and i'll be back with a nother update of my school. oh by the way i made the deans list again. doing the happy dance, doing the happy dance. woohoo.

I love you harper(happy now). I love you sarah and you are very pretty and i miss you. i love you mom and dad to. when i smothers day?? Love you guys dylan
