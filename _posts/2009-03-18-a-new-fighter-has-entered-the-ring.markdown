<p class="MsoNormal">I have long rail against killer whales. Mostly because I feel that they are getting all of the good press that should go to other more interesting Apex Predators, namely sharks, and partly because I think they are evil. I am not going to belabor the point and give you my reasons why I think they are evil; you can read my other posts to get that. What I will say is that it is time to recruit some other mammals to help us fight them.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The animal I am talking specifically about is the polar bear. To start with it is another mammal; this will limit the number of people that will claim that I am a mammal hater.<span>&nbsp; </span>The main reason is that they already hunt whales. Sure it may only be beluga whales that have trapped themselves under the ice ocean in the north, but it is still a whale.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What we need to do is find a group of these beluga whales and paint them black and white in the orca pattern. Then when the polar whales come by to hunt the trapped belugas they will start to associate the black and white with good and tasty food. Plus if the polar whales are slick they can get the whales up onto land and then it is on.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you don&rsquo;t understand what I mean when I say that they hunt whales you need to check out Blue Planet. In fact even if you know what I am talking about you need to watch Blue Planet. It shows how awesome the undersea world is. Of course part of this is showing how cruel the ocean is and how the strong survive.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course it also shows the killer whale doing what it does best; killing babies. That is right, they show a pod of orcas killing a baby gray whale. This isn&rsquo;t a sick baby but a normal baby whale that is being escorted by its mother. The Orcas surround the mom and then separate babe and mom. After the trauma of being separated from its mother the orcas kill the baby. Then they only eat the jaw and let the rest float down to the ocean floor.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What kind of evil creature kills a baby and then only eats the jaws. I know what you are thinking &ldquo;That sounds like something humans would do.&rdquo; And you would be right. That is how evil killer whales are; as evil as humans.</p></p>
