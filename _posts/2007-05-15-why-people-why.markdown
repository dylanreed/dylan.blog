Today has been quite frustrating. I have spent most of the day going around doing showings for people who don't show up. I assume that most people when they make an appointment plan on going to it. That is of course where I go wrong.  
Over half of my showings today have been no shows. This is even after the showees have been called the day before.  
Two of these showees have called insisting that they where at the property and that I am a liar and wasn't ever at the property. needless to say this makes me very angry. I may be a lot of things but I am not a liar very often and I only lie about presents and secret plans.  
So please if you are looking for a new apartment please show up for your appointments.
