Well it sumer here at the Reed compartment and since both Sarah and I have almost all of the summer off this has become the summer of projects. Here is a quick breakdown of what we have going on.

  * [Photodork][1]- Sarah has reinvented her blog by taking a photo a day and writing about it. So far she is kicking but and taking names and is doing a much better job of posting on a regular basis then I am. Check it out and enjoy the pictures.
  * House- We have built a flower box and a desk so far. We have to finish the floors this summer or I think Sarah will kill someone, probably me.
  * [Veggie Figh][2]t- My horrible web-comic is what I have been spending my time on. I need to work a little harder and try to get ahead so I can focus more on my drawing then just throwing it together super quick.
  * [Joe and Em'][3]s- Sarah and I our launching a new site that will show all of our baking, cooking and craft projects. Should be awesome. Seriously awesome.
