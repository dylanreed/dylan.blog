  content: Refresh my memory...was Total recall the one about mars?  I saw it a long
    time ago, and then a part of it the other day.  Not exactly stellar in my opinion...but
    pretty good for an Arnold film.

<p>Well Hello everyone.</p>
<p>Last night or the night before i watched the movie Total REcall. It is awesome. I recommend that if you havn't seen it that you run out and rent it right away. It is of course marked with dated special effects but still the over all affect is good. I was a little leery of it due to the fact that it is an arnold swarzanager movie of dubious quality. I loved it it is great. it has the coolest deguise i have ever seen and the story was actually good. that is all. I love sarah and everybody. goodnight</p>
