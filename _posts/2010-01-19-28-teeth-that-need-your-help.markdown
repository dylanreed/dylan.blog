<p>The other day I went to the dentist. It wasn&rsquo;t the most awesome check up but since it was the first one I have had since my wisdom teeth were pulled it wasn&rsquo;t all that bad. In fact I wasn&rsquo;t that surprised by what went down. I know that I have <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;dylansarah&#47;4275861247&#47;" target="_blank">bad&nbsp;teeth<&#47;a> . It is a fact that saddens me but on the&nbsp;same token is easily fixed. The problem is that I have really crappy enamel on the surfaces of my teeth. The rest of the tooth is fine, the enamel just gets eaten away which leads to cavities.</p>
<p>Here is the plan. It will cost approximately $976 to get my teeth fixed at the Colorado State University dentist. This is a much cheaper quote then I have received from other dentists so I am quite pleased. The problem is that with me being in school and Sarah being a public educator coming by the extra almost thousand dollars is a little bit of a stretch.</p>
<p>What can I, I single reader of dylanreed.com do to help out these poor teeth? Well, kind sir or lady, you can adopt a single tooth. For as little as $35 you can adopt an entire tooth and for a single $5 donation you will become part savior of a single tooth.</p>
<p>What do you get for your help? I will email you a copy of my mouth xray with your tooth circled, you will receive monthly updates on how my dental adventures are going until they are all fixed and a picture of me smiling when they are all fixed. All of this is delivered via the email address you provide when making your donation.</p>
<p>Is your donation tax deductable? Nope, sorry I am not an actual charity, though I promise to use all donations received through this post to fix my teeth. That means that I will not misappropriate them for video games or slurpees.</p>
<p>Any amount helps and will go towards my teeth.</p>
