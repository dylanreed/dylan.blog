Or something like that.  
On saturday there was a show on discovery channel called "Killer Squid". It was about the homboldt squid and had smoe footage and comments by one of my old instructors from dive school. It was very exciting. Thanks to Josh for letting me know.

Sarah started teacher school today. It is crazy all that she has to do. Its a good thing that she rules the fricking night.
