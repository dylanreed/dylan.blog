<p>I had decided that I would take a break from writing on dylanreed.org and focus on growing The Usable Clown. That has failed. I haven't had time to write for The Usable Clown and I have, of course, thought of things that I would like to write on dylanreed.org. Stupid head not doing what it is supposed to.</p>
<p>Mass Effect: Mass Effect is an engrossing game. I say to myself " I will just play for 20 minutes" and then an hour later I am like "Well just 20 more minutes and then I am done." It is a vicious cycle. </p>
<p>Because of Super Mario Galaxy and Mass Effect most of my dreams of late have taken place in space. I love space, its so cold and unforgiving. Take Mass Effect for instance, you basically get to choose what your character looks and acts like, so my character is a badass girl soldier who does what ever it takes to get the job done. But she likes kitties, a lot. She also enjoys long walks on ice covered planets and shooting people with her pistol. </p>
<p>When I started the game I made an engineer character. She is able to hack stuff, decrypt stuff and shot a pistol like a badass. After playing for about 30 minutes I got to thinking that maybe, just maybe, I would like to play as a badass Rambo type character. So I started over and created a semi Orlando Bloom looking space marine to kick ass&nbsp;with. Unfortunately he was a wuss and got killed really quick. I have since switched back to the Awesome Girl Engineer and am currently killing some rouge AI known as the Geth.</p>
<p>In Super Mario Galaxy I have found 70 of the 120 total stars and am still loving the game. I just found the red star that lets you fly about. It is pretty sweet. The one thing that I am disappointed about is the fact that most of the special suits (fire, ice, red star) are on a time limit. I can understand invincibility being a timed thing but not fire balls. I mean come on Nintendo, they are not that <a href="http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=198" target="_blank">cheap</a> of a weapon.</p>
<p>Apparently <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/" target="_blank">Penny Arcade</a> pissed off someone at <a href="http://www.ign.com" target="_blank">IGN</a> when they poked fun at the reviews of Assassins Creed. All the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/images/2007/20071128.jpg" target="_blank">Penny Arcade</a> guys said was that if all you do is play games to review them then you are not going to enjoy the game as much. I think that makes since, I guess the IGN folks disagreed. </p>
