  content: "hey sarah at least you got three words. i didn't even get the standardized
    five words \"jon is a dirty hippie\" though i must say that i enjoyed the paragraph
    about his lawn mower. i wish i had a lawn mower....wait what am i saying....have
    i lost my mind actually i hate lawn mowers and mowing lawns...though i always
    wanted on of those mowers you stand up on and operate with the two shifters. you
    know the ones that are like huver crafts that mow the lawn. they turn on a dime
    and i'm sure the are quite fast. though there is something to be said for a riding
    mower it is nice to sit while you mow but they are no huvor craft mowers, i bet
    a huvor mower could get the job done in 15  mins love ya all peace i'm off to
    go hug trees smell flowers and other hippie type activities \n"

Hello. I am the biggest slacker on the internet it has been since the indy 500 since i have up dated my site. here is a quick recap of what has been going on.  
__**unicycling**__  
uniculing is insane i have been doing quite a bit of it and am trying to learn how to do it one footed. idleing has gotten easier and easier and soon i should be able to juggle. i haven't tried to learn any new mounts yet but maybe later.  
__**school**__  
i am going back to school again. i am having lots of fun and am doing a pretty good job. my hardest class is golf...ok not golf but that is a fun class. i am also taking english comp which is fun but also kindof lame (hope my teacher dosn't look) and an online sociology class. i wish i could do all my classes online. that would rule. it is so much easier because all i do is read the book. read the lectures answer questions and discuss online.  
**__books__**  
i have now read almost all kurt vonnegut books. my favorites are mother night and sirens of titan. i have also recently read a man in a high castle by philip k dick. i have to reread it in order to understand it. about three days after the 5th harry potter book came out i was done with it. i would have been done sooner but i was taking a scuba diving class. so thats that  
**__scuba__**  
i am about two class away from being a scuba instructor. so that is good. it should be fun when i finally make it to instructor.  
__**other**__  
everyone should go visit harpers website(nata2.org
