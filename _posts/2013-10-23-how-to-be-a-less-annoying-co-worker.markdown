<p>Lately I have been becoming more and more grumpy. Actually angry might be a better word. Or annoyed. I am not sure what the exact term I am looking for is. It all came to a head last night when my exceedingly patient wife sat me down as was like "Duude, what is going on with you?" <--- Those are not her actual words. The words she used are far to powerful for the internet and would cause everyone in the world to chill out. And if that happens who will I argue with on facebook?</p>
<p>Work has been the cause of this frustration.</p>
<p>See how I didn't go into details about what it is. That is because this is the internet and some shit needs to stay private. But it is similar to what I have experienced at other jobs. So I thought I would write out some awesome tips for people that have jobs that force them to work with other people who also have jobs. Say in an office setting.</p>
<ol>
<li>Know what your job is - If your job says that you have to do X, then at the bare minimum that is what you need to do. You should do no other things until X is done. If you really want to do Y, X sure as hell better be done.</li>
<li>Listen to people - When some one is speaking to you, you listen to what they are saying instead of thinking about what you are going to say next.</li>
<li>Discuss, don't argue - Arguments get nothing done. Discussion is how the cool kids do it.</li>
<li>Your co-workers are not out to get you - Even if you think they are, they are probably trying to get through another day. Just like you.</li>
<li>Be a professional - Every email program I have encountered has spell check... use it. It prevents you from looking like an idiot. Also using italics in an email to signify sarcasm makes you look like even more of an idiot. Using them to give emphasis to a word that you just mis-spelled... makes me not want to work with you.</li>
<li>Be a part of the Team - I have never worked in an environment that promoted cut-throat tactics for anything. Everyone that works for a company is truly on the same team.</li><br />
</ol><br />
I am not even sure if that is everything. But seriously, work together everyone. Pettiness is never worth the cost. It is possible to work with someone who you don't like, your co-workers do it everyday.</p>
