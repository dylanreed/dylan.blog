<p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.dylanreed.com/2009/03/18/a-new-fighter-has-entered-the-ring/">post</a> was bad, really bad. I had a point in that post, I know I did, but I missed it due to my brain wondering.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am sorry about that. Rather than going back and trying to figure out what in god&rsquo;s name I was trying to write I will just move on and hope for the best.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Recently I have been fairly in control of my ADHD. For some reason this semester I have been able to focus more and my mind is wondering less. I guess that a lapse in this is to be expected at some point I was just hoping that it would happen in the middle of the summer instead of in the spring.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now that it has happened I am racking my brain to figure out what I need to do to get back on track. I am not even sure what I did to control the wondering before. I am pretty sure I got a good handle on it after I read the Tao of Pooh so maybe it is time to read it again.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am slightly annoyed by the fact that my control is slipping and want to get that control back. Stupid brain wondering off, please come back.&nbsp;</p></p>
