<p>So today I had one of those moments where I was like....'Really!!!' I found out we had some people squatting in one of our building and stealing stuff from the basement of the building.. I mean.. Really!!.</p>
<p>So to amuse my self I went to all of my fun websites and found these videos. First from <a href="http://www.threadless.com">threadless</a> it is this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JsKmu06_H0">video</a>. It is a fun video about bears. I love bears. The second is from <a href="http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com">Ctrl-Alt-Del</a>, this is the online comic that I enjoy. It is a <a href="http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/index.php/xmas2006">video</a> of the process he went through to make the <a href="http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20061225">X-mas filler graphic</a>. It is pretty neat. So these made me laugh and what not. Now off to work some more.</p>
<p>But the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzVX1V9puOo&mode=related&search=">winner</a> is awesome. Seriously. Made my day</p>
