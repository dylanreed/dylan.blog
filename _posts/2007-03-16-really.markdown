<p>So today I had one of those moments where I was like....'Really!!!' I found out we had some people squatting in one of our building and stealing stuff from the basement of the building.. I mean.. Really!!.</p>
<p>So to amuse my self I went to all of my fun websites and found these videos. First from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.threadless.com">threadless<&#47;a> it is this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=-JsKmu06_H0">video<&#47;a>. It is a fun video about bears. I love bears. The second is from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ctrlaltdel-online.com">Ctrl-Alt-Del<&#47;a>, this is the online comic that I enjoy. It is a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ctrlaltdel-online.com&#47;index.php&#47;xmas2006">video<&#47;a> of the process he went through to make the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ctrlaltdel-online.com&#47;comic.php?d=20061225">X-mas filler graphic<&#47;a>. It is pretty neat. So these made me laugh and what not. Now off to work some more.</p>
<p>But the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=uzVX1V9puOo&mode=related&search=">winner<&#47;a> is awesome. Seriously. Made my day</p>
