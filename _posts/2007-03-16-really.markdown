So today I had one of those moments where I was like....'Really!!!' I found out we had some people squatting in one of our building and stealing stuff from the basement of the building.. I mean.. Really!!.

So to amuse my self I went to all of my fun websites and found these videos. First from [threadless][1] it is this [video][2]. It is a fun video about bears. I love bears. The second is from [Ctrl-Alt-Del][3], this is the online comic that I enjoy. It is a [video][4] of the process he went through to make the [X-mas filler graphic][5]. It is pretty neat. So these made me laugh and what not. Now off to work some more.
