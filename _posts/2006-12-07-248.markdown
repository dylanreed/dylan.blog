<p class="MsoNormal">So I once again changed the overall look of my website. Harper showed me this template and set it up and then I have been tweaking it. It has a lot of neat features that allow people to enter into my life.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For example there is the current\recent <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.last.fm&#47;user&#47;awesomeguy&#47;">music<&#47;a> area. The downfall of this is that if Cher pops up it can be a dent in people&Atilde;&macr;&Acirc;&iquest;&Acirc;&frac12;s perception of how cool I am. I find that whenever there is music that I just have but don&Atilde;&macr;&Acirc;&iquest;&Acirc;&frac12;t listen to a lot on my website it takes forever for it to go away.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also there is the status section. That is from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.twitter.com&#47;home">twitter<&#47;a>. Twitter is a service that Harper showed me and I thought I would never use it. However it is quite handy and quite enjoyable. Plus then everyone can see what I am doing pretty much anytime. A fun side bit is that twitter helps me remain focused on the task that I say I am doing.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The picture section is from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;dylansarah&#47;">flickr<&#47;a>. In order for that area to become cooler I need to take more pictures. Hopefully I will be getting a camera phone for work so I can rock the random picture taking and also generally increase my awesome.<&#47;p><br />
There is a section that is a feed from my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.threadless.com&#47;profile&#47;174696&#47;reallyreallyawesomeguy">threadless<&#47;a> blog. When I first wrote there I was shocked by the number of comments I got in minutes. Another funny point I made to myself is that I have a hard time consistently updating this blog, why do I need two separate ones. Short answer: Because I can. I hope to keep up on both blogs regularly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please visit <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.threadless.com?streetteam=reallyreallyawesomeguy">here<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.threadless.com?streetteam=reallyreallyawesomeguy">buy<&#47;a> t-shirts so I can get free t-shirts that are not picked out by Harper.<&#47;p><br />
The pity party is over, things haven&Atilde;&macr;&Acirc;&iquest;&Acirc;&frac12;t gotten better we have just resigned ourselves to being poor for a while longer. So whatever you are all getting rocks from our rock garden for Christmas.</p>
<p>Oh and AWESOME</p>
