So I once again changed the overall look of my website. Harper showed me this template and set it up and then I have been tweaking it. It has a lot of neat features that allow people to enter into my life.

For example there is the current\recent [music][1] area. The downfall of this is that if Cher pops up it can be a dent in peopleÃ¯Â¿Â½s perception of how cool I am. I find that whenever there is music that I just have but donÃ¯Â¿Â½t listen to a lot on my website it takes forever for it to go away.

Also there is the status section. That is from [twitter][2]. Twitter is a service that Harper showed me and I thought I would never use it. However it is quite handy and quite enjoyable. Plus then everyone can see what I am doing pretty much anytime. A fun side bit is that twitter helps me remain focused on the task that I say I am doing.

The picture section is from [flickr][3]. In order for that area to become cooler I need to take more pictures. Hopefully I will be getting a camera phone for work so I can rock the random picture taking and also generally increase my awesome.

There is a section that is a feed from my [threadless][4] blog. When I first wrote there I was shocked by the number of comments I got in minutes. Another funny point I made to myself is that I have a hard time consistently updating this blog, why do I need two separate ones. Short answer: Because I can. I hope to keep up on both blogs regularly.

Please visit [here][5] and [buy][5] t-shirts so I can get free t-shirts that are not picked out by Harper.

The pity party is over, things havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t gotten better we have just resigned ourselves to being poor for a while longer. So whatever you are all getting rocks from our rock garden for Christmas.

Oh and AWESOME
