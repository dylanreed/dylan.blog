Since this last year has been plagued with injuries and laziness I am starting to panic. I haven't been practicing my skills like I should have been.

This was fine until I realized that in two weeks I have my annual perfomance at the childrens festival. So I need to bust out the juggling clubs and unicycle and start practicing...A LOT.

I also need to get my clown costumes together and make sure my makeup already to go. I am hoping that this year it goes really well and all the acts show up and all the performances go well.

I am hoping to possibly work in some of my magic this year, I will need to adjust all the card tricks so that they play well on stage. That I think is the only draw back to doing card tricks, they are small and don't show real well on stage.

Here is hoping.
