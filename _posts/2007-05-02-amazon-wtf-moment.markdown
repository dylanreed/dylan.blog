<p>Today I was looking online at racing wheels for the Xbox 360. I traversed the usual game sites and came across the Microsoft brand Wireless Racing Wheel. The wheel looks pretty cool, so I headed over to Amazon.com to get the good price. I searched for Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel on the homepage and got a whole slew of results. Including these two: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Wireless-Racing-Wheel-Xbox-360&#47;dp&#47;B000MVVGXW&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_3&#47;103-9161578-3986202?ie=UTF8&amp;s=sporting-goods&amp;qid=1178116329&amp;sr=8-3">1<&#47;a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Xbox-360-Wireless-Racing-Wheel&#47;dp&#47;B000HZA1QG&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_4&#47;103-9161578-3986202?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1178116329&amp;sr=8-4">2.<&#47;a> The first one is sold by another company through Amazon and is almost $80 more expensive. This confuses me. How can this ASUPERSHOP actually make money selling on Amazon. Not only is it more expensive for the same product, it ships in 6-10 business days instead of amazons 1-3 days. In fact I could by the Wheel and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Microsoft-Forza-Motorsport-2&#47;dp&#47;B000FRVCAA&#47;ref=pd_bxgy_vg_img_b&#47;103-9161578-3986202?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1178116329&amp;sr=8-4">Forza Motorsports 2<&#47;a> from Amazon for less then just the cost of the wheel. That seems wrong...just wrong. And also stupid.<&#47;p></p>
