I finally got around to calling the game guy to preorder Forza 2. I am quite happy because I was able to get rid of a bunch of games that I no longer play, and not have to pay anything out of pocket for forza 2. Awesome.

As I posted before I used to have a hard time driving around the demo track. I have now spent quite a bit of time learning the course and while I am not the fastest racer on the track I do ok.

I am quite excited for this game to come out as it will allow me to race around in cars I may never be able to afford as well as design paint jobs and fix them up spending fake money.

I am hoping to maybe get Xbox live so I can race online, but we will just have to see.
