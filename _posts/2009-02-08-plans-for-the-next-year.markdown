I am going to be 28 years old on February 14th, 2009 and I figured that it was time to set some goals for next year. I realize that I should have done this in the more typical New Years resolution style but I prefer Valentines resolutions. This is a list of things that I would like to get done, started or finished in the next year.

Despite our best efforts, Sarah and I have yet to finish our wood floors. It has been a combination of school, work, and laziness. We currently have the bedroom and stairs to finish and should be able to at least get the floors laid over spring break. Once we have the bedroom finished we will be able to order and paint the quarter round molding that will go around the perimeter of every room. Doing the stairs is a little trickier since we will have to do something about the stair facings but we should still be able to get it done this summer.

Also this year I would like to get a more feedback on the stories that I am writing. Since most of them picture books it is a been a little difficult to find people to critique them. The reason I need critiques is that I am planning on starting the submission process in March and would like to have them ready to rock in time to do that. I am waiting until March so that I have time to get my cover letter perfected and also to give me a little more editing time on my stories.

Another thing I would like to do this year is stay in school. This may sound a little strange since I am currently enrolled in school. The problem is that every time I have withdrawn from school it has been in the spring, usually after spring break. This is either because school starts to get hard or that I get lazy as it gets nicer out.

The final thing that I would like to do is craft more. Sarah and I own ten or so books full of projects. One of the things that we have talked about is picking a book and working our way through it and then just continuing on to the next book until we are through them all. Not only would we get a lot of experience but we wouldn't have to purchase a single present all year long.

Well there are my goals for my 29th year. Hope I get it all done.
