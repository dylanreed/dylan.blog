  * does anyone else think it is odd that the star trek sign and the logo for the CMAs are strangely similar? [#][1]
  * Starting ink drawing today, I am going to be really bad at this [#][2]
  * While I am enjoying the messy portion of ink drawing I am not enjoying the drawing part [#][3]
  * Are books on tape better when they are actually on tape? [#][4]
  * Running late today. And I need newsprint. Damn [#][5]
  * Dragonage or modern warfare 2. Please help. [#][6]
  * Modern Warfare two it is. Any xbox 360 folks wanna swap gamertags? I should have the game tomorrow or Saturday. Yippee! [#][7]
