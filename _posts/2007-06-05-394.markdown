<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.barterbee.com&#47;?k=RM">BarterBee.com - The Free Way to Get Movies, Music, and Games<&#47;a> is basically a barter site. You take your old movies, video games and CDs convert them into points which you can then use to purchase other peoples stuff.</p>
<p>They provide you with mailers, which then provides you with a bit of insurance on the mailing. Also since it isn't for cash it is more of a trade, I feel more comfortable not having to use a ATM\credit card to purchase or receive things online.</p>
<p>Also I think that did a god job of not focusing so tightly on one media type but also not going to broad with the products offered for barter. I think that this is a great step in the direction of a nice bartering site. I hope that this site becomes bigger and starts a movement like ebay or amazon.</p>
<p>I am going to be purusing this site and as Sarah and I come across more DVDs that we are going to get rid of I am going to start using this site a lot more. Give it a try and you may be suprised at the number of good finds on this site.</p>
<p>Plus the log is awesome.</p>
