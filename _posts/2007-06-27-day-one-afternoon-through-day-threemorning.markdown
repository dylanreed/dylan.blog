First day afternoon was full of more note taking and reviews. The teacher for the first day was pretty good though he seemed to get annoyed when someone asked a question about something the he dosen't think we need for the test.

Day Two: I was tired today and wanted to sleep a lot. I spent most of the day struggling to stay awake.  
The teacher we had today was very good and very high energy. I found her method of teaching to be quite enjoyable and it helpped me grasp the concepts of the day.

Day 3: Today was our midterm. I felt good about taking the test and got a 24 out of 25.
