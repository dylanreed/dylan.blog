We average about 2.5 miles and it is a great time to just talk. We wonder all over our neighborhood and occasionally grab a treat. The other day we were walking home and it was hot. Super hot. Then we saw them: Sprinklers. We ran through them like crazy people. This got me thinking about hobbies.</p>
<p>Hobbies are funny things. Everyone has at least one, even if it is&nbsp;unacknowledged, and they make us happy. Hobbies are also tricky. Balancing your work with your hobbies is like a tightrope.</p>
<p>Few of us are blessed with hobbies that translate easily into work. Or at least a lucrative work. Plus hobbies always cost money; either in supplies, equipment or time, which means in order to advance in your hobby you may have to work more at your real job.</p>
<p>My main hobbies, as I see them, are SCUBA diving and Entertaining. Of my hobbies entertaining is the easiest to make money with. Diving is a little more difficult to monetize. Or at least the more expensive of the two to monetize. Of course monetizing a hobby isn't the true goal of a hobby. Once you do that it isn't a hobby anymore.</p>
<p>I have been entertaining more lately and I really like it. What I like best about it is the fact that it isn't my job. It is just something I do on the weekends and random days to make some extra money. I think that the stress of making my money only from entertaining would make me not as entertaining.</p>
