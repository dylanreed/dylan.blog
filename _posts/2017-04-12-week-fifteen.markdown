This week was fun. I wrote some of the hardest things I have written. Funerals are apparently not fun to write about. It didn't help that there was a memorial service happening at work around the same time. I was in need of chocolate. 

And the worst part is that I am not finished. I am avoiding that story because I don't want to delve back into it. Maybe this weekend I will jump in. 

Another problem is that I rediscovered minecraft. It is so much fun. Digital Lego. Currently working on a underwater dome and beach town. Yay!!

Also doing a lot more research on self-care. Because, you gotta take care of yourself. And I have been a bullet journal failure this week. Sad Dylan.

But the beauty of a bullet journal is that I can start again today. I just need to do it. TODAY!!

A funny thing I have learned about ADHD meds is that they won't make me do something I don't want to. Instead, when I make myself do that thing I can stick with it until it is done. 

Hope everyone is having a great week!!
