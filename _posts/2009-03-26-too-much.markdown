  content: "the trick is aggregations. Make it so you don't have to participate in
    all the sites. make your blog or twitter the only place you participate. then
    have it feed the other places. that way you don't have to update everything. you
    just update what is important to you. \r\n\r\nI am also very against deleting
    accounts. You can usually keep accounts dormat with no ramifications. I choose
    that. Look at my myspace account. I just make a message that says \"i don't check
    this. email me\".\r\n\r\nwith that said - i do a couple things:\r\na) Google reader\r\nb)
    Twitter\r\nc) Chat\r\nd) Facebook\r\ne) Blog\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Google reader, blog
    and twitter feed into facebook. so all i do is message people there when they
    message me. I have a contact page on my site that allows people to call me through
    grand central, email me or chat with me. I can control that. I blog my complex
    thoughts and update twitter with my day to day thoughts. you are a better writer
    so i think it makes more sense for you to blog more than twitter. but you could
    install the plugin that updates twitter (and therefore facebook) with your blog
    posts. So you can kill two birds there. \r\n\r\nanyway. i am rambling. my thoughts
    are: don't quit. aggregate. Make it easy. and simple."

  content: "The aggregating method sounds interesting. I just need help doing it.
    What I want to do is make it so the only place I update is the blog. Since I get
    my twitter/facebook updates from google talk and gmail respectively I don't
    need to worry about updates. \r\n\r\nThat being said please help me set up this
    aggregate business."

  content: "Way cool!\r\n\r\nBTW - I completely understand the \"too much\" sentiment
    and I don't even keep up with that much.  My MySpace page is completely neglected
    at this point.  Facebook is hard to keep up with all on its own.  I'm also on
    goodreads, I keep 2 blogs and I follow over 100 blogs on google reader.  I'm on
    a website called The Nest which consumes way too much of my time.  But all the
    same, it's hard to give any of it up."

The internet is a funny thing. It seems that the more I get involved with it the more I have to get involved with it. I am on Twitter, Ginx (which uses twitter), Facebook, MySpace, worpress (both at wordpress.org and for my personal site), I have a site I designed for my clowning, there is Sarah's Blog, Google Groups, Google Reader, Gmail, Google Apps, Etsy,  viddler, Google Calendar, flickr, iTunes, and Aims Community College's site

These are all the places I visit on a daily basis. And for what? I don't get anything from these sites. Sure, I might get a little bit of traffic from some of them but do I really need all of them. I am not like Harper, a super internet guru. In fact I really don't like all of the crap that you "have" to do to be successful on the internet.

What should I do? I am thinking about killing all of my accounts. It will make my life simpler and give me more time to do what I like to do, write. I am a little worried that my 71 followers on twitter will be lost without me, but since I only know about 10 of the rest are not my problem. The same goes for my 170+ facebook followers. Sorry but I don't really need to know that you are my friend, person I didn't even know in high school.

Should I do it? I can't really decide. I thought about making a list of pros and cons but didn't feel that the internet is worth that kind of work. I will, of course, keep blogging and that sort of thing; I am just done with the whole social networking thing. It is too much work and I haven't seen enough reward. If I wanted to have to work at it I would make the internet into my job. Since the internet is just a hobby I will limit it to the things that I like. Like games. And my blog. And possibly Etsy.
