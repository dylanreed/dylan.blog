<h4>Synopsis</h4>

Shades of Milk and Honey is an intimate portrait of Jane Ellsworth, a woman ahead of her time in a world where the manipulation of glamour is considered an essential skill for a lady of quality. But despite the prevalence of magic in everyday life, other aspects of Dorchester's society are not that different: Jane and her sister Melody's lives still revolve around vying for the attentions of eligible men. 

<h4>Review</h4>

I first heard about this book when I was listening to Writing Excuses. I wanted to give it a try since Mary Robinette Kowal is one of the hosts. The book is wonderful. I enjoyed the story, though it is one hundred percent different than anything else I have ever read. 

Most of the books I have read have very clear cut goals. There is usually a bad guy and the romance is a subplot. This book has a mystery of sorts and a lot of romance related things. The descriptions of the magic and the world drew me into the story. 

Since I am trying to follow a book list this year, I am sad. I really want to read the next book in the series, but I will have to wait until I get ahead on the list or add it to the list for 2018.
