Finally!!!

I have been sick with a sinus-cold-energy-suck for two weeks and I am feeling better now. I didn't do a lot of drawing during this time though I am back to updating [fancy cadaver ][1]on weekdays again.

It is now time to start working on the projects that my sickness/nyquil addled brain has come up with. Look forward for some silliness in the next couple weeks at both [Fancy Cadaver][4] and [VeggieFight][5]. It will be awesome. Oh and today I made a portfolio page for Sarah on her [site][6].
