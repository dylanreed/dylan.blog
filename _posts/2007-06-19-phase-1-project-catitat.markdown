<p>Tonight when I get off work I will start the basic putting together of the frame of the Catitat. It is basically going to be 1"x2"s nailed\glued into four 4'x6' squares.</p>
<p>I will then attach three of the sides and make the third attach with three hook and eyes. This will allow us to remove a whole side for rescue\cleaning operations.</p>
<p>After the frame is built we will go get the wire netting needed to cover this bad boy. What we are looking at getting is a .5" square mesh that will allow for a good view for the cats and a feeling of scurity for Sarah and I. </p>
<p>I am also going to get a bunch of the bricks to put down as a raised floor. This will allow for the water from the rain gutter to flow by without getting the cats area wet while also allowing for a solid foundation for the house.</p>
