Don't worry Xbox 360 owners, this isn't something else you need to worry about going wrong with your system. What I am talking about is the Blue Ringed Octopus. This little cephalopod packs quite a venomous punch.

I first read about this beautiful little creature in about 3rd grade while reading The Unhuggables. While these animals will not directly hunt humans, they have been known to bite\attack people if you harass or even accidentally step on them, they will bite and probably kill you.

So, when hanging around the great barrier reef, if you see something white with blue rings, leave it alone.
