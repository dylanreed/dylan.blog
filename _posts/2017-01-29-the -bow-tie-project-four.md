![Green geometric Bow Tie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/bow-tie/Bowtie-week-4.jpg)

Here is the first round point tie. The difference between the round point and the diamond point is subtle. I love the diamond point because of the clean look they have, but the round point is softer and more whimsical. 

This is the first fabric that I picked out on my own. I went to [The Loopy Ewe](http://theloopyewe.com) and bought a bunch of fat quarters for the project. I had way too much fun picking out fabrics and am looking forward to making more bow ties. 

The hardest part of the rounded point is making the round bits actually be round. Unlike the sharp points of the diamond point, the round one requires greater care to make sure the round is round. 

<h6>BOW TIE FACT:</h6>

The number one state that wears bow ties is Mississippi.

<h3>How can you help?</h3>

Do you also love bow ties? No one needs 52 bow ties, so I was thinking I could share the making of them with others. If you want a bow tie, you just need to buy the fabric, pay for shipping,  and I will add you to the list. Shoot me an email so we can set it up. I will need to know what size your neck is. 

Since I also want to gain some bow ties from this experience I will be only opening up twenty-six of the fifty-two ties for people. So get in now or miss out. Fill out the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3)

Wish me luck and check back every week for the newest bowtie.
