<p>I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Arts-SSX-Blur/dp/B000MF6X04/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5860627-5062533?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1176253152&sr=8-1">SSX: Blur</a> from game fly the other day. All in all I have found it to be a fun if not randomly annoying. When I first received it I put it right in and played the free mode. I had such a hard time controlling my skier that I was immediately put off by the control scheme.</p>
<p>After playing through the..gasp..tutorials I gained better control of my character and found it to be a better game. I still had trouble with the slalom events but I eventually figured it out. I personally enjoy the racing aspect of the game rather then all of the tricks.</p>
<p>Why I prefer the racing is because I am, as I mentioned before, wii-tarded. I cannot for the life of me do the uber-tricks. This could be because I find things called Uber annoying or it could be because I am unable to draw the proper shapes fast enough.</p>
<p>Maybe with lots of practice I can over come my disability and become a real boy.</p>
