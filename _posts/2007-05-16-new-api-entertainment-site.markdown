<p>About a week or so ago I transformed clownsareawesome.com site into the API entertainment site. I spent a couple hours putting it all together and was fairly happy with the <a href="http://www.clownsareawesome.com">result</a>. I am a little disappointed in the look of the menu graphics but figured I could smooth those as time went on. </p>
<p>I happened to be looking around the web, like ya do, and came across <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/sprites">this</a> article on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com">alistapart.com</a>&nbsp;on making sprite like menus in CSS. I figured I would go for it. I started trying to mimic their example and finally got fed up with trying to recreate <a href="http://alistapart.com/d/sprites/ala-image3.html">this</a>, so I just created my <a href="http://ads.dylanreed.org/fancyselector/test.html">own</a>. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work in Mozilla or IE7, I don't know what I did wrong since the example on alistapart works fine in all browsers. </p>
<p>Basically, I need help. I can figure it out. <a href="http://ads.dylanreed.org/fancyselector/index.html">Here</a> is a mockup of the new API site that works in IE6, that I would like to get to work across most if not all platforms. If you have any idea on what I need to do or even just something you think I should try, let me know. <a href="http://ads.dylanreed.org/fancyselector/test.css">Here</a> and <a href="http://ads.dylanreed.org/fancyselector/1.css">Here</a> are the CSS files. </p>
<p>Do I need to combine those or is it because my menu is in a DIV instead of just on a page? Basically I am at the limit of my CSS knowledge and want to get this figured out.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any and all help.</p></p>
