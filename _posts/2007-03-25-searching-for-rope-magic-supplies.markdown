<p>So I have been trying to expand my magic horizons by learning other tricks besides card tricks. Since I have focus so long on card magic I have had some difficult to learn other magic since my card magic works so well for me.</p>
<p>Recently my friend John has started to learn coin magic, some of the stuff he does with the coins is quite fascinating and he has learned all of it from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Coin-Magic-J-Bobo/dp/0486242587">book</a> that I need to get. It seems to be the kind of book that mostly teaches the important sleights of coin magic as well as a few of the classic tricks.</p>
<p>I have also decided to learn some rope magic, I think that it will apply very well to stage clowning as well as any birthday parties I might do. There are a lot of really funny rope magic tricks and it will be cheap since all I will need to buy is rope. So I went on a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rope+magic&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">Google</a> search for magic rope to find out what kind of rope would be best to buy from the local Ace Hardware.</p>
<p>This brought me to <a href="http://ropemagic.art.coocan.jp/">this</a>(not real work safe)site. I was shocked since it is the first link from Google. I was confused and hurt by Google leading me astray on my search for magic tricks. But hey what can you do. I think I will instead just go talk to the hardware professionals or research more later using more specific key words.</p>
