<h1> The Bow Tie Project: Week Zero</h1>
I love bow ties. They are the coolest of all ties. They are fun and less likely to end up in a bowl of soup than a regular neck tie. I have been wanting to make my own bow ties for a while now, but I never bit the bullet and got started. 

Then with the start of the new year I decided to get started. Making ties takes very little fabric and not very much time. So why not make one bowtie a week. It will give me a lot of bowties added to my collection and will force me to sew more often. 

The plan is as follows: 

1. Pick a fabric to use for a bow tie. I currently have a lot of fabrics and sense Sarah works at the Loopy Ewe, she can pick me up fabric whenever I need it. 
2. Pick a type of bow tie: Bat-wing, Diamond point, Butterfly, or Jumbo Butterfly
2. Make a bow tie. Take pictures of the process. 
3. Post about it. 

From making the shark tie I learned that I need to perfect my pattern. It looks nice, but the lines could be a lot clearer on the points. It fits well and is easy to tie. I also learned that I need to use less interfacing. 


<h3>How can you help?</h3>
Do you also love bow ties? No one needs 52 bow ties, so I was thinking I could share the making of them with others. If you want a bow tie, you just need to buy the fabric, pay for shipping,  and I will add you to the list. Shoot me an email so we can set it up. I will need to know what size your neck is. 

Since I also want to gain some bow ties from this experience I will be only opening up twenty-six of the fifty-two ties for people. So get in now or miss out. Shoot me and email: dylan@dylanreed.com

Wish me luck and check back every week for the newest bowtie.
