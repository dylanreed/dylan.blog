<h4>Synopsis</h4>

Humanity is all but extinguished after a war with Partials—engineered organic beings identical to humans—has decimated the population. Reduced to only tens of thousands by a weaponized virus to which only a fraction of humanity is immune, the survivors in North America have huddled together on Long Island. But sixteen-year-old Kira is determined to find a solution. As she tries desperately to save what is left of her race, she discovers that that the survival of both humans and Partials rests in her attempts to answer questions about the war's origin that she never knew to ask.

<h4>Review</h4>

I have read a lot of YA dystopian books. I mean, who hasn't? This one has a lot going for it in the positive section: it takes place in a real place, the main character has flaws, and the other characters are fun as well. 

The point that you enter the story is great and you are led along as they try to survive. The stakes are end of the world high and unlike other YA books I have read recently this one feels like they could fail at any moment. I tore thru this book quickly and really want to read the next book.
