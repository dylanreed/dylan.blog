<p>First: Learn some new tricks. I am looking at learning some new magic tricks as well as perfect some of the ones I have had for a while. I am talking to you torn.<br />

Second: Start planning a school assemby show. This is something I have wanted to do for a while and it will be a great thing to work on for the next year since it doesn't cost anything to plan a show. Possible themes are: history of clowning, history of juggling,  or maybe just something entertaining about if at first you don't succeed try try again. We shall see.</p>
<p>Third: Buy Super Mario Galaxy and beat it, enjoy it and trick Sarah into enjoying it as well.</p>
<p>Fourth: Design a Wordpress for this sight so I can stop using other people stuff so much.<br />
<!--adsense#refer--><br />
Fifth: Redesign Clownsareawesome.com so it is truly awesome. Add Pics, Videos and more information in general.</p>
<p>Sixth: Continue to be awesome.<br />
