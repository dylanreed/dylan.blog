So sarah and I got married on september 4th 2004  
I am very happy. For those of you who didn't recieve your invitations it must have gotten lost in the mail and you can send presents to me still i won't mind

just kidding. i am working alot right now, i work 40 hours a week for the city and 10 for starbucks. i am hoping to get a full time position with the city and only have to hold one job

i will post wedding pictures later and maybe try to get sarah to post some stuff

dylan

p.s. i am eating a lot of fiber so i should post regularly now
