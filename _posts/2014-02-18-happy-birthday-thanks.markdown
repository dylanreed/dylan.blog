<p>A lot of people wished me a happy birthday on facebook and I wanted to say thanks for those wishes. I had a really nice birthday and it was nice of all of you for taking the time to say happy birthday to me. <&#47;p>
<p>Shame on those of you who didn&#39;t... <&#47;p>
<p>I had a bundle of fun over the weekend with Sarah. We saw movies, did some shopping and even cleaned our house. Sarah got me Pikmin 3 and The Wonderful 101. My parents got me some spices, Minecraft Legos and a set of Phillips Hue Bulbs. Harper got me tickets to see the Cirque Du Soliel in the spring. I am very excited. <&#47;p>
<p>Thanks family for helping me have a fun birthday. More writing later in the week. <&#47;p></p>
