I am an unmotivated student today. I have a Spanish test in about two hours or so and I don't really feel like studying. I don't really know why I just don't feel like it. Last night I tossed and turned worrying about the test and now I am up trying to study and I don't really care.

The test is over the present subjunctive and Ud., Uds., and Tu commands. I understand the concepts and think that I have the vocab, I just worry that I am going to have a brain fart when I get the test in front of me. Stupid test.

On an unrelated side note: Sarah and I are going to go play SCUBA today so that Sarah gets a little more practice. .It should be fun. Sarah is a little nervous about her upcoming adventure at Blue Hole. I keel telling her she will be fine and she still worries. I can't blame her. This will be her first Open Water dive and I am pretty sure that I was worried when I did it.

Sarah- You are going to do awesome, because you are awesome. You know how to do everything you need to do and once we practice a little more you will be ready to rock.

Everyone- Please send Sarah your happy thoughts. I will try to keep you posted of how everything goes this weekend.

Thanks to Jeffery K. and Kevron for buying me slurpees. I will post pictures of me enjoying those slurpees after I get them.
