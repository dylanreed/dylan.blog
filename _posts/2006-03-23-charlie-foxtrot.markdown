So today at work a new employee for one of my fellow coordinators came in to do some training wiht me. She came in and was immeadiatly rude to me and basically told me that I was wrong to make her do these activities and that she shouldn't have to do them. Basically I told her that since she wasn't my employee I didn't care what she did but if she wanted to work she had to do these activities.

So annoying

Oh i am starting a scheme to make millions i tell you millions

ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

I love sarah
