<p>So today at work a new employee for one of my fellow coordinators came in to do some training wiht me. She came in and was immeadiatly rude to me and basically told me that I was wrong to make her do these activities and that she shouldn't have to do them. Basically I told her that since she wasn't my employee I didn't care what she did but if she wanted to work she had to do these activities.</p>
<p>So annoying</p>
<p>Oh i am starting a scheme to make millions i tell you millions</p>
<p>ha ha ha ha ha ha ha</p>
<p>I love sarah</p>
