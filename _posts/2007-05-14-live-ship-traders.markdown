<p>I am just finishing up the <a href="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/104-6952931-8091901?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=liveship+traders&Go.x=0&Go.y=0&Go=Go">Live Ships traders</a> series by <a href="http://www.robinhobb.com/">Robin Hobb</a>. Overall I have found these books to be quite enjoyable though very frustrating at times. The frustrating has nothing to do with the writing or any technical aspect of the books, it had more to do with the story and how Robin Hobb beats her characters down before allowing them to realize their potential.</p>
<p>The depiction of shipboard life is quite fun and a nice change from the typical fantasy books that I read. I also found the idea of the live ships and where the wizard wood comes from to be quite interesting ideas and very well executed.</p>
<p>I am hoping to finish these books this week so I can start on a new series next week. Overall I would suggest these books to anyone who enjoyed Robin Hobbs previous books.</p>
