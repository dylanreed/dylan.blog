<p class="MsoNormal">So like any good addict I will make excuses. The reason I have stopped posting everyday isn&rsquo;t my fault. It is your fault. Your expectations of me are un realistic. You don&rsquo;t understand what I am going through. You have never been a 13-year old girl so you don&rsquo;t know. *runs away like girl and slams door *<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now that that is out of the way let me fill you in on what I have been up to:<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>I passed Spanish II with an A. I got a B in my other two classes this semester.<&#47;li>
<li>I have applied to CSU to go into their BFA program and study Fiber Arts.<&#47;li>
<li>I leave for a cruise in about a week and am trying to get ready. I haven&rsquo;t actually started getting ready but I need to. In fact that has nothing to do with me not posting so much as I wanted to mention that I am going on a cruise and there is a good chance that you are not. HA!<&#47;li>
<li>My gaming group failed to make the one year mark due to an over abundance of almost thirty something&rsquo;s being possessed by thirteen year old girls. This has made me sad and whiney, just ask Sarah.<&#47;li>
<li>We finally got the new work website launched.<&#47;li>
<li>I have received a Soda Stream Soda Water Machine, which again has nothing to do with me not posting but is awesome.<&#47;li>
<li>I read&#47;finished the Twilight series which may have lowered my IQ below the level needed to have a blog. In fact the Twilight series could be directly responsible, in some weird way, to the gaming group breaking up. Weird.<&#47;li>
<li>I ordered Sarah a super awesome present. It kicks butt. She is going to love it. It is a: Just kidding you have to wait and find out. Hee hee.<&#47;li>
<li>I have been working fulltime, which makes me cranky, and haven&rsquo;t had the time I need to type posts.<&#47;li>
<li>Did I mention the Cruise?<&#47;li>
<li>I got a copy of Chrono Trigger on the DS and it is sucking out all of my time.<&#47;li>
<li>I built a cat perch.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Well there are all my excuses. I will be back on the bad wagon soon enough. Of course it is actually a blog-wagon but whatever.&nbsp;</p>
