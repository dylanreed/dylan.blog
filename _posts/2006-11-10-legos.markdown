So yesterday Sarah and I went to target to get dominos. Just so everyone knows playing dominos rocks. So much fun.

While we where there I wondered off and found the LEGO aisle. Low and behold LEGO has started making a castle series again. It is called [KNIGHTSa€™ KINGDOMa„¢][1] This is good becasue when I was a kid I always wanted to build one of the ig castles and now I can.

Also they have three other things that I would enjoy building. First there is the [Aqua Raiders][2]. These are underwater adventure type legos complete with evil underwater creatures. Just look at the teeth of the Tiger Shark set and you know what I mean.

Secondly, the [EXO-FORCEa„¢][3], I like these because I have always loved the idea of riding inside a giant robot Voltron style. Plus giant robots kick ass.[![][4]][5]

Lastly, there is the [LEGOÂ® MINDSTORMSÂ® NXT][6], a kit to build your very own computer controlled robot. I know harper has one of the previous incarnations of this set and he always seems to enjoy it.

Alas, all of these cost money and though Xmas is coming I don' t know if I should ask for toys for presents. Also, where would I play with them and how many pieces would our fat cat eat
