<p>So yesterday Sarah and I went to target to get dominos. Just so everyone knows playing dominos rocks. So much fun.</p>
<p>While we where there I wondered off and found the LEGO aisle. Low and behold LEGO has started making a castle series again. It is called <a href="http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=K8823&cn=354&d=70">KNIGHTS&acirc;&euro;&trade; KINGDOM&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;</a> This is good becasue when I was a kid I always wanted to build one of the ig castles and now I can.</p>
<p>Also they have three other things that I would enjoy building. First there is the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Leaf.aspx?cn=468&d=70">Aqua Raiders</a>. These are underwater adventure type legos complete with evil underwater creatures. Just look at the teeth of the Tiger Shark set and you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Secondly, the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Leaf.aspx?cn=34&d=70">EXO-FORCE&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;</a>, I like these because I have always loved the idea of riding inside a giant robot Voltron style. Plus giant robots kick ass.<a href="http://www.dylanreed.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/WindowsLiveWriter/LEGOS_7DED/11%5B25%5D.jpg"><img align="right" src="http://www.dylanreed.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/WindowsLiveWriter/LEGOS_7DED/11_thumb%5B23%5D.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Lastly, there is the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=8527&cn=17">LEGO&Acirc;&reg; MINDSTORMS&Acirc;&reg; NXT</a>, a kit to build your very own computer controlled robot. I know harper has one of the previous incarnations of this set and he always seems to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Alas, all of these cost money and though Xmas is coming I don' t know if I should ask for toys for presents. Also, where would I play with them and how many pieces would our fat cat eat</p>
