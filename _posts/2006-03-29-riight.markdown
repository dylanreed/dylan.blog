So last friday I lost my jerb, it sucked. So then after a weekend of oh shit, I started to work for my father, which is weird only becasue I am working for him in a capacity that i have never done before. I am basically taking little parts of a lot of jobs enabling people to do their jobs better.Ã¯Â¿Â½ So that is good
