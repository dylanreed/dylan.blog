<p>Yesterday I was helping my dad pick up some new equipment for the tractor. By help I mean that I had to drive it from point A to point B (about 4 mles) to pick up a new attachement. SO I hopped on the John Deere and headed out. I thought that it was going quite slow, but since it was a tractor and not a race car I was ok with that. When I got about 1000' from my destination, I saw my dad walking towards me so I slowed and stopped next to him.</p>
<p>He asked it I knew that the tractor had a road gear that allows you to go about 15mph. Since I had spent the past hour going 3.9mph I was sad. The best part is that my Dad thinks that this is the funniest thing that has ever happend.</p>
