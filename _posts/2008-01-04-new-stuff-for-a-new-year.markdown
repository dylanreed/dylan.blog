<p>I have finally started using Etsy a lot. Well not a lot but more then I have. The only thing that makes me sad is that when I started my account my username was&#47;is awesomeguy. That makes my store awesomeguy's store. LAME. Anyway visit me at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;awesomeguy.etsy.com" target="_blank">awesomeguy.etsy.com<&#47;a>. I am making and try to sell sock creatures. They are awesome. If you would like to send me your old socks. Seriously I need them. For every ten pairs you send me I will send you a sock creature.</p>
<p>I have been making about one a night since we got back. Last night I took a night off because I need to get some old neckties to add to some of them. So if you need a strange and yet</p>

<p>awesome gift for a loved one or coworker or boss, check them <a href="http:&#47;&#47;awesomeguy.etsy.com" target="_blank">out<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I have shaved off the facial hair, I do have an image as an entertainer to uphold and I have a problem with clowns that have facial hair. I didn't want to be one of them. I do how ever have some really nice pictures of my self with a moustache. Basically with a moustache and the right sunglasses I look like Goose from top gun. I enjoyed my foray into the world of Facial Hair and hope to venture back next Xmas with mutton chops. Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Overall the trip to Japan was full of fun and good times. We ran around like crazy people in Tokyo the first couple of days and then took a train and ran around Hiromi's hometown scaring the natives. We (Harper, Hiromi, Sarah and I) stayed in Hiromi's Grandparents old house. With no heat. They had a neat heated table that kept us warm and electric blankets for the sleeping. On the way home Sarah and I where bumped to business class which was ridiculous. Pictures <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;tags&#47;xmas2007japanreed&#47;">here<&#47;a>.</p>
