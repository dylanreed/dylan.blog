You may have read the [Harper Post][1]. I wrote that over the course of a month or so and it is probably one of the posts that I thought most about. I wanted to be able to express a point without making anyone feel like I slighted them. I have, at times, had a lot of younger sibling bitterness. Because of this bitterness I have not always expressed my feelings in a way that doesn't hurt peoples feelings. I am sometimes bad at words.

   [1]: /?p=1639

When I finished up the post I almost deleted it. I was scared of how it would be received by my family. I didn't want them upset because of anything I said. I didn't want to come off as super bitter or hateful. This terrified me. It lingered in my drafts file for a long time. I didn't know what to do. Then I had the best idea ever.*

Those of you that have hung out with me for any length of time know that I can be a little bit scatterbrained. I forget things a lot. Like whether it is lunch or dinner we are currently eating. I am also the best person to tell secrets to as I will most likely forget them before they ever come up again. I decided to use this knowledge for good.

Here is how it went down. I finished making sure that the post was finished. Then, in a moment of brilliance, I set the publish date for a random day in the future. I worried about it for like an hour and the promptly forgot.

A couple months past when suddenly I received a couple of RT of an auto tweet that happens when I publish a blog. All I could think was "Well I can't unpublish it now." It was a great feeling because I had posted something that I felt strongly about while not having the stomach wrenching guilt that follows posting something that may upset people I care about.

I think it worked like a charm. A hilarious charm. And of course I didn't need to worry. Everyone was cool with it and rereading it I don't really know what I was worried about.

*Idea isn't probably the best ever.
