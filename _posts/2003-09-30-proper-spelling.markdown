<p>So school is funny for me. I enjoy waking around campus and seeing all of the people. The funniest thing for me is that some girls still get dressed up every day for school. Why?? I sure don't also I don't really look that good in a skirt. Speaking of skirts... why would you where a short skirt (just below your but) and a winter coat?? I will never understand. Ever. It is also funny for me to learn geography. Geography rocks. My professor Dr. Dunn is insane. He makes learning fun and educational. (As learning should be) I am still working at the fort of fun. It is ok. It would be better if I got free video games all the time. I played Simpson?s pinball on Friday night it is an overall good pinball game and covers everything Simpson?s. From rocket ships to a qwick e mart. I sometimes cannot spell very well. I had to right an essay in math class. It was cool I guess. I basically go t to rant on why I dislike the math class. So far I have tried to spell class-calls-calss it rocks. I got a 96 on my first math test. It was pretty awesome. So that is all<br />
