<p>The childrens festival went great this year, all of the entertainment acts showed up and the audiences at all of the performances where responsive and larger then previous years.</p>
<p>The only problem we had is we got a pretty crappy sound set up. This wasn't a problem for a lot of the day except when we had dance acts. All of the dance groups understood except for one who I am not sure quite understood what I was saying.</p>
<p>It was nice this year because I didn't have to perform very much other then introducing the acts. The previous years I have had to fill one to three slots when acts wouldn't show up. This year I just had to fill in when people got done early.</p>
<p>I had a really great interaction with one of the little ballerinas, right before her group went on stage. I had her teach me some ballet moves and over all it was rather amusing. I got yelled at by the entire audience to point my toes when I do turns and what not. Good times.</p>
