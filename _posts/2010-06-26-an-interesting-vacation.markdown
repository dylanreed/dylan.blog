<p>Last week is the last of two weeks that I have had off from my other job. Needless to say Sarah and I where going to spend it blissfully finishing projects around the house and being awesome. Then we heard the big news... My Uncle Kevin was going to get a Kidney Transplant. This was shocking news because as far as we knew he needed a new kidney but was just starting to get added to the list. In fact he was added to the list two weeks ago and got really lucky.</p>
<p>My mom, who's side of the family Kevin is from, decided she wanted to head to Alburquerque to visit. So off we went. Sarah and I drove with my mom to NM to provide our support as delicious meal cookers and errand runners. I would normally write all about this sort of thing and do my best to describe what we saw but luckily you don't have to sit through that. What I will do instead is link to Sarah's <a href="http://photodork.org/">blog</a>. She has been doing a photo a day of at PhotoDork.org and so instead of a thousand words you can just look at her pictures.</p>
