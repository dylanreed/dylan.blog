“Oh man, oh man”

I ducked frantically from the punch that was sure to cave in my head. Being just over five feet tall and tipping the scales at a whopping 120lbs one hit was going to kill me. This guy was huge and had so many muscles. I guess being a girl wasn't going to matter with this guy. Apparently he hadn't heard of chivalry. I danced around, doing my best Ali shuffle, and dodged another punch that was followed by a vicious kick. 

In comic books it seems like all the villains want to talk before they kill you. Not this bruiser. I had barely walked into the room when he took a swing at me. Maybe that means he is a henchman? Who knows? Best to put him down quick and be done with it. I drew Bessie from off my back and swung it as hard as I could. 

Bessie is a baseball bat, a nice old steel baseball bat. She doesn't look like much but she is good at putting pain in people’s brains. I have had her for as long as I can remember. The last left over legacy from my parents. She kicks ass. 

Of course I should have known that strong doesn't equal slow. Not only did he dodge my swing but he caught my arm and threw me at the wall. Luckily those years of gymnastics have paid off allowing me to control my trajectory and land in a somewhat more graceful heap. 

I kip back up onto my feet and feel myself get angry. I reach for the cord in my bag and plug it into Bessie. I take another swing and make contact. The nice thing about a steel bat is that it conducts electricity from the car battery in my bag. The resulting jolt is enough to stop a rhino and it stops the bruiser. I like to think that the solid blow to his head helped. 

I take a moment to assess the damage. I am definitely going to be sore in the morning. It looks like my outfit has survived, which is good since I just finished paying for it. They don’t tell you when you start the total cost of being a super hero. Not only do you have to custom order everything, you better not break it because you either have to be a genius to fix it or have a back up or just do without why it is getting repaired. 

My costume is your basic model five super suit, which is better then a model six but not as nice as a model one. Once you get below model six though you get to customize the look a lot more. I loved battling baddies in a skintight Lycra body suit as much as the next girl but not having to show off everything every time I went out is nice. Plus I look so much cooler now. 

My outfit consists of a skintight neoprene and Kevlar bodysuit with protective ceramic armor around vital areas. The neoprene is a dark purple that almost looks black and is bullet resistant. In this case resistant means stops it from hitting your skin but still bruises the hell out of you. Sure I can take a bullet and not bleed to death but I can still get internal injuries. Best to just not get shot.
 
The armor panels are lime green and will stop just about anything that a crook should have. There is also a green rubber skirt that goes almost to my knees while not inhibiting mobility at all. As far as masks go I started with a plain black domino mask. I hated it. It was hard to get it to stick on and provided no protection for my head. I know have what is known in the catalogs as a cue ball cowl. It is a combination helmet and mask also in dark purple. I wear knee high lime green soft soled acrobat boats that go up to my knees. According to the designer I worked with I look pretty cool.
 
Instead of the typical utility belt, which every hero uses, I have a messenger bag. It holds a car battery (until I can get a smaller power source), my notebook (because taking notes is always a good idea), a change of clothes (because secret identities are not joke) and your basic sleuthing gear (which really is just a smart phone with a camera). I carry Bessie on a strap on my back.

All right everything seems to be ok. Nothing broken, sure I was going to be bruised but at least I was still alive. Time to take a closer look at the other guy. He was at least six and a half feet tall. And boy did he have muscles. Upon closer inspection I notice that he has a collar around his neck, like some sort of high tech dog collar. I take a quick snap with my phone. 

Suddenly I hear the distinct click of a gun being cocked. On instinct, stupid instinct, I throw myself through the window. Going through glass hurts. And it hurts a lot more when you realize you are ten stories up. I guess at least I won’t get shot.
