If you follow me on twitter or facebook you have probably seen the pictures I did this week that I called Dino-Roar. I thought I would share this sketch with you and then I will post a picture of the final project when I finish it in about 4 weeks. This is my first time experimenting with nice markers, and possibly markers in general. All I have to say so far is the Prismacolor makes really nice markers, really nice but expensive markers.

I may scan the image so that it looks nicer because my iPhone take crappy pictures of my art work.
