  content: Hi! Goals for artists are a great idea. Many of us (me!) aren't known for
    our focus and tenacity. I set goals every week, and I consider myself lucky to
    meet at least one of them. Love your site!

<p>I have decided that I need to give my self a little more direction on what I am going to draw on Fancy Cadaver. Otherwise it just ends up being random collection of drawings. Which is fine except I don't think I am growing as much as I would if I had a specific goal each week.</p>
<p>On that note next weeks drawings will be:</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Some Bunny to Love<&#47;span><&#47;h2><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">I know it is horrible but hey it is almost easter.<&#47;span></p>
