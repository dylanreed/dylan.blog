I have about two weeks of school left. Ahhhh! I am not saying that I am not ready to be done with school; it's just that I have neglected my history class a bit. I have done a really good job of keeping my Spanish class in line: getting an 82% on my last test and my Intro to PC Applications class is a joke. History, however, is a different story.

The reading is just so boring. I have five chapters to read and the quizzes to take for those chapters. Luckily I started my paper for the class and am more than half done for, I just have to finish that by Friday and keep reading my eyes out.

The reason that I am having such a hard time being dedicated to history is that it is not nearly as exciting as the Art History class I took last semester. Most likely this is because through Sarah I absorbed a bunch of Art History without knowing. Plus the professor was someone I knew in high school.

Alright, deep breaths, you can do it Dylan, kick History's boring ass back to the Stone Age.
