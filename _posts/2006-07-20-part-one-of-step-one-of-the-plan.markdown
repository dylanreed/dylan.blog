<p>I need to purchase this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.weirdthings.com&#47;ibooks.htm">book<&#47;a>. It is called Illusion Tech and it teaches how to design and build a bunch of illusions.</p>
<p>I am hoping that maybe this payday I can maybe order them. I will need to talk to the treasurer of the project ( <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanreed.org&#47;wp-admin&#47;www.photodork.org">sarah<&#47;a> ) to see if I can get it. I sure hope so.</p>
<p>Also I am rocking the real estate classes for work. I have quite a bit left to go but i am steadily pluging along. Soon I will be a REAL----TOR. What!</p>
<p>Sarah is bringing me Wendy's.</p>
