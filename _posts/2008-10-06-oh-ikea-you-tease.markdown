  content: "UPDATE< ------------------------------------->UPDATE\r\n\r\nIKEA called
    us two days ago, more specifically the shipping company did. They were calling
    to setup a time to deliver. By setup a time they mean that they will be at our
    between this time and this time and you better be there to accept the delivery.
    \ Basically it was the opposite of setting up a time. On the plus side it worked
    out that they can deliver it today while I am actually home."

<p>Sarah and I recently ordered some stuff from IKEA to be delivered to our house through there Direct program. About two days after placing our order I recieved and email that stated:<&#47;p><br />
<blockquote>
<p>Your order [our order number] was shipped from our warehouse on 9&#47;25&#47;2008. <&#47;p>
<p>Ship To: <br &#47;>[Our Address ]<br &#47;>[Where we live]<br &#47;>Phone Number:[ our number] <&#47;p>
<p>Please allow 3-7 business days for the In-Home Delivery Provider to call the number listed above to schedule your delivery.<&#47;p><&#47;blockquote>
<p>From this email I gathered that our order had shipped and we would hear from the delivery company in 3- 7 days to set up what I like to call a delivery plan. After not hearing anything by today I took matters into my own hands, Internet vigilante style. I got a hold of their customer service number and called. After selecting my option and waiting for the real person to answer I was ready. I gave them my order number and asked what was going on. They told me that they had expected our delivery to be arrive around the 2nd of October, but due to some craziness that they couldn't&#47;wouldn't explain it was just sent, today, to the shipping company. This upset me a little bit. Ok it upset me a lot. We paid a lot for shipping and they hadn't even bothered to let us know that there was a delay in our product leaving wherever it was before it was shipped.  <&#47;p>
<p>According to the nice lady I spoke with, and she was nice, we should expect a call in 3-7 business days from today. I suggested that they should revise their email to reflect that possibility of delay or let the customer know when a delay happens. She explained to me that the email is generated and sent when the order leaves their warehouse and travels to the delivery companies warehouse. She also said that the delay could have been caused by them having to find everything for our order. Which, if the email is generated when our order leaves their warehouse, dosen't make a lot of sense. I am quite annoyed.  <&#47;p>
<p>I don't even know what I want. I really want to be reimbursed for the shipping that we paid. Ideally I would like to get it all back, but I would take partial reimbursement. Unfortunately IKEA has a customer service black hole with specially trained people who are able to just talk in circles and accomplish nothing. I couldn't get escalated up to the next level no matter what I said or asked for. The lady was just doing her job but god it was annoying. <&#47;p>
<p>IKEA you are lucky that we really like your stuff. Otherwise we might never go to the IKEA that will be in Denver next year.  <&#47;p>
<p>Also I am frustrated with this dairy that we are trying to use to get delicious milk and yogurt. They where supposed to drop off our first delivery yesterday but, alas, nothing arrived. I have used their fancy online contact form as well as called and left a message and have received no a response. Watch yourself Diamond D Dairy your on the list. <&#47;p></p>
