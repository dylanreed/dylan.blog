<p>Everything that you have read about making money with google is true. Well I guess I don't know everything you have read, so here is what I am referring to. </p>
<p>As I have tried to make my blog(s) into more lucrative affairs I have done a lot of reading about what makes a blog a money maker. One of the top things to do is to make your blog fit a niche. I always thought that that was silly as I would love a blog that talked about everything I like and so that is what dylanreed.org has always been. Well dylanreed.org really hasn't made me rich yet.</p>
<p>The Usable Clown hasn't made me rich either, though it is putting up a better fight. In cruising around clown websites I found that there wasn't a good place to get information on the business side of clowning. So I made one. I have a growing subscriber base and it has a higher click through rate then any of my other sites.</p>
<p>Another thing I read about was that regular posting will help grow you reader base. And it does. I have been fairly regular in posting on The Usable Clown and my readership has gone up. It helps that I am writing on a subject that people are interested in. I don't think it would matter how often I updated dylanreed.org, until I pick a consistent subject to write about people aren't going to care enough to subscribe.</p>
<p>The last thing that has helped is that I have gotten involved in the social scene of clowning. I try to post relevant response and posts at all of the clown forums I can find, furthering my credibility as a clown. I also try to direct people to The Usable Clown through my signature if possible.</p>
<p>Now I really need to start doing the same thing with sea monster stuff and crafting stuff. Someday.</p></p>
