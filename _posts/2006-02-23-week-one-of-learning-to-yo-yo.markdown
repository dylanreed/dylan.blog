  content: The problem with your lyn fury not coming back up is due to a lack of a
    bind.  Once you learn to do that, you can get even the most unresponsive yo-yo's
    to return. They have a yoyo very similar to the FreeHand Zero with rubber shells,
    not to protect your hands, but the yoyo actually. It works both ways though.

  content: Good to know. I actually forgot about Yoyoing until you commented. I will
    have to dig them out and give it a go again.

<p>So I am learning to YoYo thanks to Harper and the <a href="http://www.howtoyoyo.com/">HowToYoYo</a> crew. Until Happer hooks me up with a login there I will post here:</p>
<p>Here is the plan: I will get a yoyo from harper, (I actually got two yoyos a <a target="_blank" title="Duncan FreeHand zero" href="http://www.extremespin.com/yo-yos/duncan/Freehand-Zero-LG.jpg">Duncan Freehand zero</a> and a <a target="_blank" title="Lyn Fury" href="http://www.extremespin.com/yo-yos/yoyojam/Lyn-Fury-LG.jpg">Yoyojam lyn fury</a>.) and then I will use <a href="http://www.howtoyoyo.com/">HowToYoYo</a> to learn. I have spent the last week learning the 10 tricks that Mark <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dylanreed.org/wp-admin/HowToYoYo">suggested</a> as well as hurting my fingers. I have gone through all of those tricks and feel pretty comfortable with them.</p>
<p>The only problems I have run into are that my Lyn Fury doesn&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;t like to come back. It does tricks and then just hangs there, so I need to work on that. The other problem I am having is that my finger gets all chaffed and raw.  Pro yoyo players have some hardcore fingers.</p>
<p>Now with the Freehand I keep beating the hell out of my knuckles. I think that they need to put soft rubber on the rim so that I stop hurting my hand. Once I stop hurting my hand I can practice at work because I will cuss less.</p>
