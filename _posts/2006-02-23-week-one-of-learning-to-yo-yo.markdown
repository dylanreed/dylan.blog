  content: The problem with your lyn fury not coming back up is due to a lack of a
    bind.  Once you learn to do that, you can get even the most unresponsive yo-yo's
    to return. They have a yoyo very similar to the FreeHand Zero with rubber shells,
    not to protect your hands, but the yoyo actually. It works both ways though.

  content: Good to know. I actually forgot about Yoyoing until you commented. I will
    have to dig them out and give it a go again.

So I am learning to YoYo thanks to Harper and the [HowToYoYo][1] crew. Until Happer hooks me up with a login there I will post here:

Here is the plan: I will get a yoyo from harper, (I actually got two yoyos a [Duncan Freehand zero][2] and a [Yoyojam lyn fury][3].) and then I will use [HowToYoYo][4] to learn. I have spent the last week learning the 10 tricks that Mark [suggested][5] as well as hurting my fingers. I have gone through all of those tricks and feel pretty comfortable with them.

The only problems I have run into are that my Lyn Fury doesnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t like to come back. It does tricks and then just hangs there, so I need to work on that. The other problem I am having is that my finger gets all chaffed and raw. Pro yoyo players have some hardcore fingers.

Now with the Freehand I keep beating the hell out of my knuckles. I think that they need to put soft rubber on the rim so that I stop hurting my hand. Once I stop hurting my hand I can practice at work because I will cuss less.
