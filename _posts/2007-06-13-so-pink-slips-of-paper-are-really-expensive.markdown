<p>I have been using the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mylibrary.us">library<&#47;a> a lot to save myself from buying all of the books I want to read and have been having quite a bit of fun doing it. That was until today...</p>
<p>Last week I have ordered a book interlibrary loan style. That basically means that the local library system didn't have it so they had to borrow it from another districts libraries. It went off without a hitch and I was allowed to borrow it until July 5th or there would be crazy $1.00 a day late fees.</p>
<p>When I received the book there was a pink piece of paper wrapped around the front cover which I took off and used as a bookmark. once I finished the book I took out the bookmark(pink slip) and threw it away prior to returning the book to the library.</p>
<p>Apparently you have to keep that piece of paper on the book when it is an interlibrary loan. Since I didn't do this I have been assessed a $1.00 fine for the book, even though I turned it in two weeks early.</p>
<p>So apparently that pink paper is more expensive then the check-out receipt I normally use as a bookmark. I told the librarian that I was un-aware of the needing to keep the pink slip part of interlibrary loans and no one mentioned it when I checked out the book or that there would be a fine if it was missing.</p>
<p>She didn't care. At all. So I punched her. In the nose. Real hard. She cried. Just kidding.</p>
