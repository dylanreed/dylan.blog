Quick, to the BATWING MOBILE!!!

This is the first batwing bow tie. And this is my new favorite style. Batwing, then diamond point. The batwing just has a better shape than the others. 

With this one I also put a contrasting fabric on the back side. This makes for an interesting tie. When you tie it you can flip the knot to make it a contrasting color or it will just add a nice fun accent color to the tie. 

This fabric wasn't purchased for ties, but in fact was purchased to be curtains. While cutting the curtain fabric I may have accidentally cut out a bow tie. That is the nice thing about bow ties is they take so little fabric and are easy to sew. 

<h6>BOW TIE FACT:</h6>

Black is the most popular color of bow tie. <b>BORING!</b>

<h3>How can you help?</h3>

Do you also love bow ties? No one needs 52 bow ties, so I was thinking I could share the making of them with others. If you want a bow tie, you just need to buy the fabric, pay for shipping,  and I will add you to the list. Shoot me an email so we can set it up. I will need to know what size your neck is. 

Since I also want to gain some bow ties from this experience I will be only opening up twenty-six of the fifty-two ties for people. So get in now or miss out. Fill out the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3)

Wish me luck and check back every week for the newest bowtie.
