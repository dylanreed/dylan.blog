<p>So I found a fun game to waste my time...what little I have. It is called <a href="http://toribash.com">Toribash</a>. It is basically turn based fighting, this means that you can manipulate all of the joints to relax, hold, contract or extend. Once you make all the changes you want you press space. Then your enemy does the same. It is a lot of fun to mess with and makes you want to make martial arts movies. I think this game would work good on the wii. Let people customize their avatar and then fight each other on line. Somehow I think you can add swords and the like.</p>
<p>I kind of want to register the game so I can have access to the full game and play around a little more. Stupid money getting in the way once again.</p>
