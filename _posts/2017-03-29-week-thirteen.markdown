Apparently lack of sleep weakens your immune system. Who knew? Well I suppose science did, but no one likes them anyway. 

This was a fun week, despite all of the mucus coming out of my face. Mostly the weekend. I started on Adderall this week, which has been interesting. I find that it really does help me focus and I have been much more productive at work. 

When I get home I am ready to sleep. Not really. I actually haven't found much of a crash with the Adderall. I have had trouble sleeping, but I think that has more to do with the caffeine withdrawal and stress at work. 

I have awesome people in my life who support me and I am lucky for that. One of those friends heard I was having sleep problems and sent me a diffuser along with some essential oils to help with sleep. 

Now that I am feeling better I am hoping that I will sleep better. 

Everyone have a great week!!
