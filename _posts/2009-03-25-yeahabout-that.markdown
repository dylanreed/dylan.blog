<p>I have had the lamest <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanreed.com&#47;about&#47;">about<&#47;a> page on this site for about a year now. Seriously it was sad. I have fixed it up now and am quite happy about it. The problem with the old one is that it felt slapped together and to be honest it was. I wasn&rsquo;t even trying when I wrote it, I just felt that I needed to have an about page so I wrote an about page.  <&#47;p>
<p>The new and improved about page is fantastic. It has all of the things I look for in an about page, except lies. I usually like to read an about page and find the one fact I am pretty sure is fabricated. I was going to add a fabricated sentence but alas I couldn&rsquo;t come up with a good lie. Some of the ideas I batted around were:
<ul>
<li>Dylan is the founder of the Hate the Whales coalition <&#47;li>
<li>Dylan fought in the Second World War <&#47;li>
<li>Dylan likes to punch babies <&#47;li>
<li>Dylan has a bachelor&rsquo;s degree <&#47;li><&#47;ul> <&#47;p>
<p>Unfortunately none of those really floated my boat. I instead went with the always fun truth disguised as lies. I also added a totally sweet picture of me holding a soda can when I was in Japan. You can&rsquo;t tell very well from the picture but the can has a large breasted anime lady holding a soda bottle in her cleavage. Awesome.  <&#47;p></p>
