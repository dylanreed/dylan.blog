Let;s talk about puppets!!

I don't think this is the first time I have mentioned puppets on this blog, nor will it be the last. 

As a child who grew up with the muppets and muppet related movies, one might say that they had some influence on my life. Jim Henson was an amazing person who changed puppetry forever. He was the embodiment of someone who plays for a living. And that is all I have ever wanted to be able ti do. 

The idea of being able to play for a living is what led me to clowning and all of the skills I learned before I was twenty. As I have gotten older (read: hurt) I have been stepping further and further away from the extreme physicallity that my brand of entertaining requires. It just hurts too much.

Where do puppets come in? Simple, puppets fill two areas that drive my life: Entertaining and Creating. With puppets I get to create something from raw materials with my bare hands. Every puppet I have made in 2019 has been 100% hand sewn. 

Being hand sewn is important because it is the traditional way of making puppets, and it allows me to be directly involved in the puppets creation in an intimate way. When I finish a puppet I am able to look at it and know that every stitch was done by me to the best of my ability. 

There is something hilarious about well done puppetry. The puppeteer's ability to bring an inanimate object to life with just their hands boggles the mind. The fact that Kermit the Frog is basically a sock puppet with metal rods attached to his hands and he is still entertaining to watch. 

The skill needed to perform a puppet on video is rediculous. First you need a monitor to get a view of what is happening on screen. Then you have to train your brain to understand that everything on the screen is opposite of what you think. And then you have to sync your voice to that of your puppet. AND you have to make sure your puppet stays level. That is just the very basics. 

The first puppet I made was in 2013(check) were simple. I made them with leftover fleece and fur that I had lying around. In fact I think everything I used to make those puppets was a scrap in our garage. They look alright but they aren't the best made, or the best looking. But they were a start. 

Fast forward a number of years to about a month ago. I work for a hospice company and, while the work is rewarding, I got my emotional butt kicked right around New Years Eve. It was time for some self-care.


I headed to JoAnn's fabric and bought supplies

With xero plans I started fabricating the puppet that was to become Tim. Tim is a basic sock type puppet. I created the pattern and then kept modifying it until I was happy. The biggest difference between the start and the finished product was the addition of a foam "skull" to make his head stiffer. 

As I was working on the finishing touches I remembered a tutorial I had read during my first foray into fabricating puppets that had used a carved piece of foam to create that tongue. So I gave that a try. Thanks to my past life painting warhammer minis, I had some paints to use and somehow settled on an orange tongue. 

With the help of /r/puppets, I made the decision to add teeth. Again I carved them out of foam. It was a lot of fun and turned out pretty nice. As I learned attempting to carve teeth again, I got lucky that first time. Adding some plain black doll eyes completed the face, and gave him a pretty nice brow ridge as well. But he was naked.

As luck would have it Sarah and I had recently purchased a Cricut. A Cricut is like a printer, but instead of printing it cuts, scores, and draws. I was able to use it, an old t-shirt, and a Simplicity pattern to make a shirt for a doll. 

As anyone who has attempted to make doll clothes will tell you, it is hard. Everything is so small, and t-shirt material is a pain to sew with already. But I finished it. But it was missing something. Digging around in some old files I found a graphic I had made and submitted to threadless when Harper worked there. I give you "Our Lady Bunnylupe".

I should really put it on a candle. 

The Cricut has a neat feature that lets you print an image and then it will cut it out perfevtly. This let me have a perfevtly cut out iron on, sized for the doll shirt, to add some flair to Tim's overall look. 

As with all things I start, I never go halfway. I am not going to make a puppet and not try to make better puppets. Plus I had bought enough fleece, fur, and foam for a number of puppets. 

Since I am also a chronic researcher, I started to research puppet making. Nothing had really changed in the five years since my last puppet, except the availibility of supplies. 

One of the materials that made The Muppets look so good was the fleece they used. Called Antron Fleece, it is the gold standard for fleece puppets. What makes it so amazing is its ability to hide seams. 

Take Kermit the Frog. His head is made of two pieces of fleece sewn together in the middle. But you can not see that seam. This is because the combination of Antron fleece and careful hand sewing means you can pick the seams and it is like they are not there. 

If on the other hand you look at Tim, even though I tried my best, you can still see the seam. But fret not, for Antron fleece is not longer just for Muppets.

Last time I was making puppets Antron fleece was availible in white only and you had to hand dye to get colors. This was a messy and intensive process that I was not interested in doing. I told myself that I didn't need the good stuff. That was a lie.

There is a shop now, a magical shop, that sells Antron fleece. In multiple colors. It is amazing. Puppet Pelts is a amazing. They have an option to order seconds of fleece. These are pieces that have flaws in them. So I ordered one. 

Meet Dad-Joke Doug. He is  made with flawed Antron fleece and mongolian faux fur (which I also got from puppet pelts). You will notice that the seams on his head are almost invisable. Actually they are pretty hard to see, except I know where they are. 

You will also notice that Doug has those fancy eyes. With the advent of 3D printing, you can get puppet eyes that aren't just ping-pong balls. And there is nothing wrong with ping-pong balls. Kermit's eyes are basically ping-pong balls. 

But having the ability to get eyes in different shapes, with a nice finish, is fantastic. It got me thinking: What if I had a 3D printer?

After some research, I was like "Nope". I am apparenlty to cheap to spend money on a 3D printer. Then I remembered that Harper had given one to my dad for Christmas. So I inquired what the status of said printer was. 

My dad has a nice work shop set up in his garage. He does work on his lathe and has recently started making stainedglass art. Which he did on the sly, so he could surprise us with art for Christmas. Sitting in a corner of his garage was the 3D printer. 

Initially my plan was to design stuff and then set up the print at his house and hang out while it printed, or to check on it through out the day. But because my dad is aweosme, he let me take it home. And then told me to keep it. 

Since then I have been printing a lot of puppet related items. Mostly eyes, but experimenting with joints and what not. For making puppet eyes, it works a treat. Other things haven't gone so well.

(cyclops)

Here is a cyclops puppet I made, including the 3D printed eye. I ordered some cabochuns to make the iris with. This is a little domed glass thing that slightly maginfies what is underneath. I found a graphic of an eye, modified the color, printed it out and glued it onto the eye. 

This is actually version 2 of the eye. This version has an indent for the iris to rest in. This makes it look a little less glued on. In the next version I plan on making the indention a little bit smaller.

The cyclops is made using the same mongoliam fur and antron fleece as Doug. I was inspired by some puppets I saw online to add the fleece parts, and I think it makes her look great. 

The first monster I made was a more traditional monster puppet. This puppet uses the same pattern as Doug and really shows that you can make such a different character using different materials. 

(Pink Monster)

This monster has 3D printed teeth, which was the first thing I created and printed for a puppet. Sanding teeth that small is a real pain in the butt, but the finished product is worth it. The eyes come from a company called FurriFingers out of the UK. They make horns, teeth, and eyes for puppets. Their 3D printed eyes with Cabochun iris inspired me to make the cyclops eye. 

You can probably see the difference in the fur on Sharon, the cyclops, and Bernard, the pink monster. The biggest difference is that Sharon got shaved. It was the most terrifying and satisfying experiment I have done with a puppet.

The process is simple. Just take a shaver and shave off the fur. I went with a uniform length all over and it went well. The whole time I was just waiting to screw up and ruin the puppet, but I got lucky. 

During this last month I have also made some puppets for other people. Purely through offering on twitter I have been commisioned to make three puppets. I finsihed one, a Blue Tim. I am waiting on a eyes to arrive for the second one, a Purple Monster Tim. And the third is for a super secret project I am not supposed to talk about.
