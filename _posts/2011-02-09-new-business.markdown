<p>[caption id="attachment_1189" align="aligncenter" width="367" caption="The Cadavers here are the Fanciest"]<a href="http://www.fancycadaver.com"><img class="size-full wp-image-1189 " title="Picture 1" src="http://www.dylanreed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Picture-1.png" alt="" width="367" height="355" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fancy Cadaver is alive. It isn't what I initially intended it to be but I am really enjoying have a specific place to put my drawings for those of you who don't really care about my life and just want to see what I am currently drawing. So please check it out today.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On a completely unrelated side note, there are going to be fewer drawings while I figure out a plan of attack on all of this drawing business. I am going to try and do at least one a day but depending on the day it may be fewer... or it may be more.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The reason is that I am not sure what to do. I am still going to try and work my way through a drawing book a week I am just not sure which books to start with. I am basically done with my Cartoon Cool book that started all of this retro style and I am not sure if I should continue in that vein of drawing or head off in a different direction. I can get most drawing books at the library, which does nothing to limit my choices. I just recieved (thanks to <a href="http://nata2.org">Harper</a>) a new book on drawing cartoon animals, which could be fun.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyone have an opinion. I am up for drawing anything... secretly I want to draw more chibis.</p></p>
