So today has been an eh day

I have spent it running around at work and even though we got a sweet new copier I just feel eh

So here is the reasons.

1. Sarah and I are broke ass poor

2. There is no end in sight

3. We don't qualify for financial help cause we make to much money. (this is for hospital bills)

4. No one wants to help.......sad|-__-|

Thats it pity party is on. Please RSVP, we are registered at the bank.

Dylan
