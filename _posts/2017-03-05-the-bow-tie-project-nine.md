Another week another heart bow tie!! 

The other day I went without a bow tie. I was tired and just didn't feel like wearing one. It felt super weird to be at work without one. 

Coming soon: A tutorial and pattern for bow ties so you can sew along!! How exciting is that? Super exciting. 

<h3>How can you help?</h3>

Do you also love bow ties? No one needs 52 bow ties, so I was thinking I could share the making of them with others. If you want a bow tie, you just need to buy the fabric, pay for shipping,  and I will add you to the list. Shoot me an email so we can set it up. I will need to know what size your neck is. 

Since I also want to gain some bow ties from this experience I will be only opening up twenty-six of the fifty-two ties for people. So get in now or miss out. Fill out the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3)

Wish me luck and check back every week for the newest bowtie.

Don't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)
