<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nata2.org&#47;2007&#47;06&#47;14&#47;heh-crackers-just-tried-to-social-engineer-me&#47;">Harper<&#47;a> just posted about how some crackers called him to try to try and get into his server and do <strong><u><em>VERY BAD THINGS<&#47;em><&#47;u><&#47;strong> to or with his server. Upon reading the title of his post here is went through my mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crackers = White people</p>
<p>Using a racial term doesn't seem very Harper, especially since he himself is white.</p>
<p>WTF, Harper hates white people</p>
<p>WTF why are white people specifically trying to trick Harper<&#47;blockquote><br />
After all of that I figured out what he meant by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.catb.org&#47;~esr&#47;jargon&#47;html&#47;C&#47;cracker.html">crackers<&#47;a>.<br />
