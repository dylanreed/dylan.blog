<p><a href="http://www.nata2.org/2007/06/14/heh-crackers-just-tried-to-social-engineer-me/">Harper</a> just posted about how some crackers called him to try to try and get into his server and do <strong><u><em>VERY BAD THINGS</em></u></strong> to or with his server. Upon reading the title of his post here is went through my mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crackers = White people</p>
<p>Using a racial term doesn't seem very Harper, especially since he himself is white.</p>
<p>WTF, Harper hates white people</p>
<p>WTF why are white people specifically trying to trick Harper</blockquote><br />
After all of that I figured out what he meant by <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/cracker.html">crackers</a>.<br />
