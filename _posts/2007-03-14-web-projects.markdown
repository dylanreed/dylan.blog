Here are some of my web projects that I have been working on:

  * [ClownsAreAwesome.com][1]: This is a site I started to discuss my feelings on entertaining and clowning. I write about everythig from clowning basics all the way up to performance mechanics.
  * [IMADEIT][2]: This is my shop where I sell purses, hoodies and scarves that my wife and I make. Check it out, we make awesome, awesome stuff.
  * [ClownUsability][3]: This is where I discuss my feelings on making websites more user friendly.
