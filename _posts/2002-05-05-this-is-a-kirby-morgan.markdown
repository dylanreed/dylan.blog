excerpt: "This is a kirby morgan bandmask 18b. on last thursday in my class we were
  required to breathe from just the shell of the mask. the shell is the yellow part
  of the mask. the trick with this is that there is no seal over your mouth so you
  have to sip the air out of a pocket you create. you have to go under and do this
  for 10 minutes. they have three tanks and one person in each tank. the first three
  people that went where unable to do it. since I was part of the next group i started
  to get a little nervous. when my turn came i suited up with my 28 lbs of weught
  and my steel toed bottom boots. i was in my wetsuit and had the shell in hand. as
  i walked down the later the water started to creep up my wetsuit. talk about cold.
  really really cold. i placed my head all the way underwater to get used to the frigid
  water. i then test breathed the shell, it was easy. i then headed to the bottom
  of the tank. a whole 9 ft of water. once you reach the bottom you have to move to
  the viewport in the tank so master diver bob cave can watch you brethe. every two
  breathes you have to pull the mask away from your face and number off 5 on your
  hand. it was fun. i started taking the mask off and doing either a front or back
  flips instead of counting.  this is an exercise that simulates what you have to
  do if your mask blows off of your face. in the afternoon we did shell buddy breathing
  which was two people sharing one shell underwater. it was fun two breathes and pass,
  repeat. it was really fun. on tuesday i think we are going to start using the full
  masks including the kirby morgan superlight 17 and 27, kmb 18b and the miller. all
  of hose are demand hats. this means that you get air when you inhale and so it uses
  less air and is more efficient.  the other type is freeflow, ex. desco or mark v.
  in free flow the air just constantly flows through the helmet. the demand hats have
  what is called an oral nasel mask that is like what fighter pilots use to breathe
  at high altitudes. anyway that was thurs. love dylan\r\n"
