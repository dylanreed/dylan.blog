<p>I am sick and tired of feeling sick.<br />
I hate not being able to sleep very well and also the fact that snot is constantly running from my nose.<br />
Having said that I am done with the bitching.<br />
Yesterday I was able to flash five balls about 6 or seven times in a row. Its just a matter of time until I am able to juggle 5 stright.<br />
Its my birthday in about 3 weeks or so. I'll be 23. So Old. heehee. I'll put up a b-day wish list later i think. </p>

<p>I think it is funny that I find it necessary to sign all of my post(well almost all)</p>
