I am sick and tired of feeling sick.  
I hate not being able to sleep very well and also the fact that snot is constantly running from my nose.  
Having said that I am done with the bitching.  
Yesterday I was able to flash five balls about 6 or seven times in a row. Its just a matter of time until I am able to juggle 5 stright.  
Its my birthday in about 3 weeks or so. I'll be 23. So Old. heehee. I'll put up a b-day wish list later i think.

I think it is funny that I find it necessary to sign all of my post(well almost all)
