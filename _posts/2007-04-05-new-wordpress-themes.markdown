<p>Harper changed his <a title="Nata2 new theme" href="http://www.nata2.org/2007/04/05/new-theme/">theme</a> to a very simple them, one without graphics and a pretty bland color scheme. I like it but I feel that since I know him as my brother, he needs to add a little more pizzazz to make it fit hi personality. Maybe even just add one color besides gray and link blue.</p></p>
