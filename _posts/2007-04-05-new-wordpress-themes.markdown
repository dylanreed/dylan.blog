<p>Harper changed his <a title="Nata2 new theme" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nata2.org&#47;2007&#47;04&#47;05&#47;new-theme&#47;">theme<&#47;a> to a very simple them, one without graphics and a pretty bland color scheme. I like it but I feel that since I know him as my brother, he needs to add a little more pizzazz to make it fit hi personality. Maybe even just add one color besides gray and link blue.<&#47;p></p>
