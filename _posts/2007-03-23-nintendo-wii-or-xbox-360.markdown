<p>So I own both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-LU308684100-Wii/dp/B0009VXBAQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693605&sr=8-1">Wii</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Console-20GB-Hard-Drive/dp/B000B43OY4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693629&sr=1-1">Xbox 360</a> and I find them both to be quite enjoyable, though I play the 360 more. This is because I am a lazy gamer. Even though I find the wii more enjoyable to play I find that I would rather sit on the couch and relax then move a lot when I play.</p>
<p>I also tend to be playing games while I am making dinner. My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Console-20GB-Hard-Drive/dp/B000B43OY4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693629&sr=1-1">Xbox 360</a> has better range on the controller since it is not based on my position to the tv. I got to thinking about this when I realized that I was playing my older Xbox games instead of finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Twilight-Princess/dp/B000FQBPCQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693664&sr=1-2">Zelda</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wii-TC700011-Trauma-Center-Opinion/dp/B000GPW2QO/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693686&sr=1-1">Trauma Center</a>. It has nothing to do with the quality of games, there has just not been a game I have played on the Wii that is a great screw around game. Whereas <a href="http://www.amazon.com/THQ-752919550021-Saints-Row/dp/B000BLM5PG/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693703&sr=1-1">Saints Row</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bethesda-39013-Elder-Scrolls-Oblivion/dp/B000GE7O9K/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693721&sr=1-1">Oblivion</a> are great screw around games when you have a short time to play.</p>
<p>I am thinking that this will change once I start to get more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-LU308684100-Wii/dp/B0009VXBAQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693605&sr=8-1">Wii</a> games from <a href="http://www.gamefly.com">Game Fly.</a></p>
