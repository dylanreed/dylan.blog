<p>So I own both the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Nintendo-LU308684100-Wii&#47;dp&#47;B0009VXBAQ&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693605&sr=8-1">Wii<&#47;a> and the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Xbox-Console-20GB-Hard-Drive&#47;dp&#47;B000B43OY4&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693629&sr=1-1">Xbox 360<&#47;a> and I find them both to be quite enjoyable, though I play the 360 more. This is because I am a lazy gamer. Even though I find the wii more enjoyable to play I find that I would rather sit on the couch and relax then move a lot when I play.</p>
<p>I also tend to be playing games while I am making dinner. My <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Xbox-Console-20GB-Hard-Drive&#47;dp&#47;B000B43OY4&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693629&sr=1-1">Xbox 360<&#47;a> has better range on the controller since it is not based on my position to the tv. I got to thinking about this when I realized that I was playing my older Xbox games instead of finishing <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Legend-Zelda-Twilight-Princess&#47;dp&#47;B000FQBPCQ&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_2&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693664&sr=1-2">Zelda<&#47;a> or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Wii-TC700011-Trauma-Center-Opinion&#47;dp&#47;B000GPW2QO&#47;ref=pd_bbs_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693686&sr=1-1">Trauma Center<&#47;a>. It has nothing to do with the quality of games, there has just not been a game I have played on the Wii that is a great screw around game. Whereas <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;THQ-752919550021-Saints-Row&#47;dp&#47;B000BLM5PG&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693703&sr=1-1">Saints Row<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Bethesda-39013-Elder-Scrolls-Oblivion&#47;dp&#47;B000GE7O9K&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693721&sr=1-1">Oblivion<&#47;a> are great screw around games when you have a short time to play.</p>
<p>I am thinking that this will change once I start to get more <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Nintendo-LU308684100-Wii&#47;dp&#47;B0009VXBAQ&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1&#47;002-3393638-4322433?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1174693605&sr=8-1">Wii<&#47;a> games from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gamefly.com">Game Fly.<&#47;a></p>
