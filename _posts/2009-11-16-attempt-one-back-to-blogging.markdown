<p>For some reason over the past four months, possibly longer, I have had little or no desire to blog. Nothing personal against you guys, it is just that I have been trying to find my stride at school. It was going well until I was hit with the H1N1 or as I like to call it the Swine Death Plague. That knocked me out for a little over a week and I have been playing catch-up ever since. Luckily CSU has been cool with the whole pandemic business and I didn't fall that far behind. I am finishing playing catch-up today and I figured I could up date my blog and get back in the swing of writing. For your viewing pleasure, here is what I have been up to:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="300" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fdylansarah%2Fsets%2F72157622816401400%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fdylansarah%2Fsets%2F72157622816401400%2F&amp;set_id=72157622816401400&amp;jump_to=" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fdylansarah%2Fsets%2F72157622816401400%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fdylansarah%2Fsets%2F72157622816401400%2F&amp;set_id=72157622816401400&amp;jump_to="></embed></object></p>
<p>That slideshow is all of the sculptures I have produced thus far, in reverse order. It should go clown, donut, chair, but flickr dosen't display it that way. I have had a good time in sculpture class and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. Drawing one on the other had has been a great experience though I learned that I am not great at drawing.&nbsp; My fiction class was boring at first but now that we are reading One Hundred Years of Solitude it has become quite a bit of fun. Biology is super boring, I want to sleep when I am in that class. Seriously. Boring.</p>
<p>Sarah is good, though right now she has the bronchitis and wishes that would stop. The cats are good and pesty. In fact everything seems to be going good.</p>
