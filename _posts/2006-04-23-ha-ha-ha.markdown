<p>So i got a call from Jesus stating that I had offended him by saying that i was sewing my soul away from him. He said that he hates sewing and has no interest in my soul.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>My sewing machine is back, Oh Yeah!!!! I have made 3 purses today as well as finishing the hard one I started a while ago.</p>
<p>I have been reading up on the random Da Vinci code stuff and it makes me laugh how afraid people are of it as well as how people don't really know that it is fiction. It seems that everyone thinks that Dan Brown is passing it off as a text book,</p>
<p>Good for him I say.</p>
<p>That is all</p>
<p>Dylan</p>
<p>Oh and my cell phone still sucks</p>
