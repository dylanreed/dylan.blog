<p>Alright so my site is looking better and better. I am starting to update more frequently and to try and make it awesome. I plan on creating a deadly underwater stuff resource page where you can go and scare yourself out of SCUBA diving. Also I am going to collect a lot of information on the near earth asteroid that is going to hit us in 8000+ days. </p>
<p>Clown wise I have quite a few gigs coming up, this friday I am doing a picnic for work and then on the 9th of July I will be at both Eaton and Lasalle days. </p>
<p>Sarah and I painted are room, here is what the critics are saying:<br />
<em><br />
Well its....interesting<&#47;em>--Mike Ross</p>
<p><em>You know what, I like it<&#47;em>-- Nan Allen</p>
<p><em>This color is f**king sweet<&#47;em>--Dylan Reed</p>
<p>Its a color called dark jungle, its a dark green and it is just fabulous.</p>
<p>Work is good, I just try to get everything done by the time the day is over. Mostly I do, mostly. Sarah's job is her most favorite thing in the world. That might not be entirely true she might secretly love our cats more, but I'm not telling.</p>
<p>Ok everyone most vote for which clown face they like best A or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dylanreed.org&#47;media&#47;album08&#47;IMG_0821">B<&#47;a> the difference is the wig, I need 10 votes by friday. comment to vote.</p>
