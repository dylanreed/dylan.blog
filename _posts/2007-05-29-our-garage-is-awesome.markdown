We spent what little time we had not painting fixing up our garage. We have installed two new storage cabinets and a workbench. Now we have a great craft\project work area as well as everything having a place to call its own.

We spent most of the weekend organizing our house and this has made us feel like bad-asses. the only problem is that we neglected to take naps as well as relax. We did watch a lot of movies and enjoyed that quite a bit.
