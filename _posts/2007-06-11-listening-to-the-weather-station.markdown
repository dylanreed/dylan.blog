<p>Sunday Sarah and I went over to my parents house to help put together my dad's new fancy weather station. It was a pretty fun time of doing manly things and it went up pretty fast.<&#47;p>
<p>The funniest thing about putting it up was that we put everything together, drilled holes and ran all the wires; then we read the instructions and found out that we needed to move the transmitter from being in the hot sun to being in the shade.<&#47;p>
<p>I will say that typically when my family embarks on a project, planning is kept to a minimum and results to a maximum. Basically we don't read instructions. Ever.<&#47;p>
<p>Apparently the weather station is working, though I haven't checked in with the parents today to make sure.<&#47;p></p>
