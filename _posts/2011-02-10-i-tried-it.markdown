<p>As promised I attempted the Manga drawing. It wasn't so bad.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://fancycadaver.com/2011/02/10/manga-girl/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Colored Manga Girl" src="http://fancycadaver.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mangagirl-3.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="570" /></a></p><br />
I am pretty happy with the way it turned out. In fact I am pleasently surpised since my first attempt at a western comic character was pretty <a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/5202013058_028da18b40_o.jpg">pathetic</a>. Then I thought about it and I figured out why. I read western style comics, I don't read manga. Because of this I have an "idea" of what superheros should look like. This leads me to second guess myself everytime I draw one. With manga the oppisite is true. I have never read manga and the anime that I have watched hasn't had the same impact that comics have. Since I have no frame of reference then I have no room to second guess. It is pretty awesome. The coloring on this is ok... I am not 100% happy with my work with markers, probably should have done it digitally so that I didn't suffer from a lack of colors that I have in markers, which you can help <a href="http://www.dickblick.com/lists/wishlist/3D7SKCUGDOZQY/publicview/">with</a> ;). &nbsp;I am not upset with the coloring job, I think it looks nice though I think she looks a little vacant. What I really liked about this drawing was the final pencil work, which I have because I forced myself to trace the inks instead of going over the pencil. I did this partially because I wanted it to look nicer and partially because this was a complex drawing and I was afraid I was going to screw up. Here is the pencil:</p>

<p>I just found out that the Chibi book is in at the library, which I will pick up tomorrow and play with. Then I guess I have to choose a book to do. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylansarah/5413454361/sizes/o/in/photostream/">Retro Cartoons</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylansarah/5433667824/sizes/o/in/photostream/">Robots</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylansarah/5413438219/sizes/o/in/photostream/">Chibi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylansarah/5433901534/">Anime</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylansarah/5433664538/sizes/o/in/photostream/">Cute Animals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylansarah/5416283057/sizes/o/in/photostream/">Retro Action Cartoons</a></li><br />
</ul><br />
If you have an opinion of which I should pursue first let me know. Soon. I have to decide before I am thirty.Which is Monday.</p>
