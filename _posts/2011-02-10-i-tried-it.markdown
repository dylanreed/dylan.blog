<p>As promised I attempted the Manga drawing. It wasn't so bad.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http:&#47;&#47;fancycadaver.com&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;10&#47;manga-girl&#47;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Colored Manga Girl" src="http:&#47;&#47;fancycadaver.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;mangagirl-3.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="570" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;p><br />
I am pretty happy with the way it turned out. In fact I am pleasently surpised since my first attempt at a western comic character was pretty <a href="http:&#47;&#47;farm5.static.flickr.com&#47;4129&#47;5202013058_028da18b40_o.jpg">pathetic<&#47;a>. Then I thought about it and I figured out why. I read western style comics, I don't read manga. Because of this I have an "idea" of what superheros should look like. This leads me to second guess myself everytime I draw one. With manga the oppisite is true. I have never read manga and the anime that I have watched hasn't had the same impact that comics have. Since I have no frame of reference then I have no room to second guess. It is pretty awesome. The coloring on this is ok... I am not 100% happy with my work with markers, probably should have done it digitally so that I didn't suffer from a lack of colors that I have in markers, which you can help <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dickblick.com&#47;lists&#47;wishlist&#47;3D7SKCUGDOZQY&#47;publicview&#47;">with<&#47;a> ;). &nbsp;I am not upset with the coloring job, I think it looks nice though I think she looks a little vacant. What I really liked about this drawing was the final pencil work, which I have because I forced myself to trace the inks instead of going over the pencil. I did this partially because I wanted it to look nicer and partially because this was a complex drawing and I was afraid I was going to screw up. Here is the pencil:</p>

<p>I just found out that the Chibi book is in at the library, which I will pick up tomorrow and play with. Then I guess I have to choose a book to do. The choices are:</p>
