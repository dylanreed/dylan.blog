Well it happened: I missed a Bow Tie Post. I am not surprised that it happened, but it is a bummer. I was doing so well with all of my different posts and projects, but alas I lost my momentum. 

When I realized that I wasn't ready for a post on Sunday I was pretty bummed. The feeling of failure is not a stranger to me, but I still don't like it. It just means I have to make two bow ties this week. 

But why did I miss it? Because I need to know so I can learn from my mistake. I think it is pretty simple: I didn't take the time to finish the tie I started. I would like to say that it was out of my control, but I am in control of how I spend my time and I didn't make a tie when I had the chance. 

On the plus side, instead of making a bow tie I got through the first edits of *Rio Borealis*, which had been taunting me for quite a while. Now I just need to get those edits transferred into scrivener and give it another read through. 

So, deep breaths and positive thoughts for the next week.
