<p>I have been spending a lot of time participating in the online clown community and have found that I have a lot to say. So I am going to start writing about clowning more...just not here. <&#47;p>
<p>I have decided that since Dylanreed.org is a site about me and my life and interests, it is hard for me to hold an audience. However if I am just going&nbsp;to&nbsp;write about clowning, that is a specific audience and subject, I might be able to retain readers a lot better. <&#47;p>
<p>I need to also find a domain that has to do with killer whales because <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanreed.org&#47;2007&#47;04&#47;03&#47;killer-whalesorcas-revisited-2&#47;">this<&#47;a> post is the most read post I have ever had. So if I had a sweet sea monster or killer whale domain, i could continue to give my quasi scientific rants about dangerous creatures underwater. Who knows??<&#47;p>
<p>More info to come.<&#47;p></p>
