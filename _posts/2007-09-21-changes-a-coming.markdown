I have been spending a lot of time participating in the online clown community and have found that I have a lot to say. So I am going to start writing about clowning more...just not here. 

I have decided that since Dylanreed.org is a site about me and my life and interests, it is hard for me to hold an audience. However if I am just going to write about clowning, that is a specific audience and subject, I might be able to retain readers a lot better. 

I need to also find a domain that has to do with killer whales because [this][1] post is the most read post I have ever had. So if I had a sweet sea monster or killer whale domain, i could continue to give my quasi scientific rants about dangerous creatures underwater. Who knows??

More info to come.
