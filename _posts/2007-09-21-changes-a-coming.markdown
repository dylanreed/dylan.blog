<p>I have been spending a lot of time participating in the online clown community and have found that I have a lot to say. So I am going to start writing about clowning more...just not here. </p>
<p>I have decided that since Dylanreed.org is a site about me and my life and interests, it is hard for me to hold an audience. However if I am just going&nbsp;to&nbsp;write about clowning, that is a specific audience and subject, I might be able to retain readers a lot better. </p>
<p>I need to also find a domain that has to do with killer whales because <a href="http://www.dylanreed.org/2007/04/03/killer-whalesorcas-revisited-2/">this</a> post is the most read post I have ever had. So if I had a sweet sea monster or killer whale domain, i could continue to give my quasi scientific rants about dangerous creatures underwater. Who knows??</p>
<p>More info to come.</p></p>
