<p>So today I saw this on my twitter:<&#47;p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>nata2: fixing dylans blog... i mean.. "upgrading"<&#47;em><&#47;p><&#47;blockquote>
<p>So I sent Harper a nice little message to find out how he was screwing up my stuff. Right after I asked I had to go to a meeting so I kind of left him hanging. Here is the chat:<&#47;p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>me: what are you doing to my blog<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>Harper: fixing it ;)<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>3:46 PM&nbsp;i helped my buddy scott with his blog<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>and in the process found some cool plugins<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>so i added them to your blog<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>me: oh i see<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>Harper: you were not around<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>i added<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>slimstats<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>so you can see who is coming<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>like analytics<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>but just for wordpress<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>and related posts<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>to drive traffic from one post to another<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>and then optimal tital<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>title<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>and also sitemap generator<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>to get better google placement<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>;)<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>3:47 PM&nbsp;and i deleted all your themes<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>cuz there were too many<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>i hope you are not mad<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>that i didn<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>i did that<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>and then wished i hadn't<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>cuz i didn't know if you had work in there<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>and right now i am upgrading you to the newest version of wordpress<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>3:48 PM&nbsp;sound good?<&#47;em> <&#47;p>
<p><em>i hope its ok<&#47;em><&#47;p><&#47;blockquote>
<p>I love Harper because his rambling apology\wish I wouldn't have made me laugh.<&#47;p></p>
