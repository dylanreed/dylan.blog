<p>So today I saw this on my twitter:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>nata2: fixing dylans blog... i mean.. "upgrading"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So I sent Harper a nice little message to find out how he was screwing up my stuff. Right after I asked I had to go to a meeting so I kind of left him hanging. Here is the chat:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>me: what are you doing to my blog</em> </p>
<p><em>Harper: fixing it ;)</em> </p>
<p><em>3:46 PM&nbsp;i helped my buddy scott with his blog</em> </p>
<p><em>and in the process found some cool plugins</em> </p>
<p><em>so i added them to your blog</em> </p>
<p><em>me: oh i see</em> </p>
<p><em>Harper: you were not around</em> </p>
<p><em>i added</em> </p>
<p><em>slimstats</em> </p>
<p><em>so you can see who is coming</em> </p>
<p><em>like analytics</em> </p>
<p><em>but just for wordpress</em> </p>
<p><em>and related posts</em> </p>
<p><em>to drive traffic from one post to another</em> </p>
<p><em>and then optimal tital</em> </p>
<p><em>title</em> </p>
<p><em>and also sitemap generator</em> </p>
<p><em>to get better google placement</em> </p>
<p><em>;)</em> </p>
<p><em>3:47 PM&nbsp;and i deleted all your themes</em> </p>
<p><em>cuz there were too many</em> </p>
<p><em>i hope you are not mad</em> </p>
<p><em>that i didn</em> </p>
<p><em>i did that</em> </p>
<p><em>and then wished i hadn't</em> </p>
<p><em>cuz i didn't know if you had work in there</em> </p>
<p><em>and right now i am upgrading you to the newest version of wordpress</em> </p>
<p><em>3:48 PM&nbsp;sound good?</em> </p>
<p><em>i hope its ok</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I love Harper because his rambling apology\wish I wouldn't have made me laugh.</p></p>
