So today I saw this on my twitter:

  


> _nata2: fixing dylans blog... i mean.. "upgrading"_

So I sent Harper a nice little message to find out how he was screwing up my stuff. Right after I asked I had to go to a meeting so I kind of left him hanging. Here is the chat:

  


> _me: what are you doing to my blog_
> 
> _Harper: fixing it ;)_
> 
> _3:46 PM i helped my buddy scott with his blog_
> 
> _and in the process found some cool plugins_
> 
> _so i added them to your blog_
> 
> _me: oh i see_
> 
> _Harper: you were not around_
> 
> _i added_
> 
> _slimstats_
> 
> _so you can see who is coming_
> 
> _like analytics_
> 
> _but just for wordpress_
> 
> _and related posts_
> 
> _to drive traffic from one post to another_
> 
> _and then optimal tital_
> 
> _title_
> 
> _and also sitemap generator_
> 
> _to get better google placement_
> 
> _;)_
> 
> _3:47 PM and i deleted all your themes_
> 
> _cuz there were too many_
> 
> _i hope you are not mad_
> 
> _that i didn_
> 
> _i did that_
> 
> _and then wished i hadn't_
> 
> _cuz i didn't know if you had work in there_
> 
> _and right now i am upgrading you to the newest version of wordpress_
> 
> _3:48 PM sound good?_
> 
> _i hope its ok_

I love Harper because his rambling apology\wish I wouldn't have made me laugh.
