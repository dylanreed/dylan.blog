Harper recently hooked me up with the related post plug-in for my blog. So check it out. If you travel to a posts page it gives you a bunch of related posts to go with it. I find this to be interesting and I just spent about 15 minutes reading all my old posts as they where related to people.

I would love to see a map of how all the posts are related to each other.
