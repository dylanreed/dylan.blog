<p>As Sarah and I have been trying to take care of our debt we have realized two things.</p>
<p>One is that once credit cards have you they will do as little as possible to keep you as a customer. This is because that once you owe them over $1000.00 they will get enough money in interest to not need you as a customer. I think that credit cards as an idea are a good thing. I just feel that in practice they are lacking in customer service and a need to please customers to keep them.</p>
<p>The second thing is that everyone has this problem. You can almost not function without a credit card in the world today. It is a sad fact of life and there is little you can do about it unless you are independently wealthy.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://www.cardguide.co.uk/articles/credit_card_types.html">two</a> <a href="http://www.cardguide.co.uk/articles/rate_tart.html">articles</a> that might help others stop the flow of bad debt choices by all.</p>
