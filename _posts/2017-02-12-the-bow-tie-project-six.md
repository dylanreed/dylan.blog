![Grey, Derby, Moustache Bow Tie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/bow-tie/Bowtie-week-6.jpg)

This is a tie for a gentlemen. Or at least someone who fancy's themselves a gentlemen. Moustaches and derbys galore. I wish that this fabric didn't have a pattern on it because it is such a nice grey color. 

This is a round point tie. I didn't have my rounding game very well figured out, so the edges are less perfect. But I am learning. One thing I need to figure out is how to work with patterns so that they are right side up on all sides. 

I noticed while sewing this one that my machine is running a little rougher, so it might be time to do some sewing machine maintenance. Hopefully it is nothing major. 


<h6>BOW TIE FACT:</h6>

A collector of neck ties is known as a grabatologists.

<h3>How can you help?</h3>

Do you also love bow ties? No one needs 52 bow ties, so I was thinking I could share the making of them with others. If you want a bow tie, you just need to buy the fabric, pay for shipping,  and I will add you to the list. Shoot me an email so we can set it up. I will need to know what size your neck is. 

Since I also want to gain some bow ties from this experience I will be only opening up twenty-six of the fifty-two ties for people. So get in now or miss out. Fill out the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3)

Wish me luck and check back every week for the newest bowtie.
