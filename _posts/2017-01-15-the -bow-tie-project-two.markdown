![Navy with Gold Flower Bow Tie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylanreed.com/gh-pages/Images/Bowtie-week-2.jpg)

Another week, another bow tie. This fabric is a wonderful navy blue with gold flowers. Finished, this tie looks classy and wonderful tied. I have three bow ties that I have purchased and this one is the nicest looking tie I own. 

I think that I have my butterfly pattern about perfected. There are a few small things I will adjust to make the corners sharper and the curves smoother, but I am happy with it. Now it is on to the other types of bow ties. 

I am intrigued by the Batwing bow tie. It isn't a tie I have ever worn but it has a much stronger shape than the butterfly. Reading more about bow tie shapes I have found that by making small adjustments to my patterns I can create numerous tie shapes. 

Next week I am going to make a diamond point. I will also try and list the fabric I use to make each tie in case you want to make the same tie. And maybe I'll upload the patterns so you can make ties too,

<h6>BOW TIE FACT:</h6>

Pediatricians prefer bow ties over the long neck ties as the kids could not grab them


<h3>How can you help?</h3>
Do you also love bow ties? No one needs 52 bow ties, so I was thinking I could share the making of them with others. If you want a bow tie, you just need to buy the fabric, pay for shipping,  and I will add you to the list. Shoot me an email so we can set it up. I will need to know what size your neck is. 

Since I also want to gain some bow ties from this experience I will be only opening up twenty-six of the fifty-two ties for people. So get in now or miss out. Fill out the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3)

Wish me luck and check back every week for the newest bowtie.
