<p>As I mentioned in a previous post, Sarah and I have canceled direct T.V. We have signed up for Blockbusters answer to netflix and find that going in to get new movies by exchanging out mail-in returns feels like stealing. <&#47;p>
<p>It makes me sad for netflix, mostly because this idea of mail-order DVDs seems to have been their idea, but Blockbuster incorporating their stores has soundly defeated them. All netflix has done to answer is make it so you can download movies, which would be great if iTunes didn't exist. <&#47;p>
<p>Also, we where able to clean up our entertainment center and make it look awesome.<&#47;p></p>
