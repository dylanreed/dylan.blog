So today I found out that my uncle who bought my bug from my dad sold it. no more bessie the bug of love. sad day. 

Sarah's week at school has been hectic thus far. It should get better and then next weekend off to vegas for our anniversary. yeah

I am currently listening to enders game. it is quite good and it makes me want to read the book so i will get that sometime and read it. It reminds me of phillip k. dick a little. Mostly because it is a science fiction but at the same time it is also more about enders feeling s and perceptions.

thats all for now
