<p>So today I found out that my uncle who bought my bug from my dad sold it. no more bessie the bug of love. sad day. </p>
<p>Sarah's week at school has been hectic thus far. It should get better and then next weekend off to vegas for our anniversary. yeah</p>
<p>I am currently listening to enders game. it is quite good and it makes me want to read the book so i will get that sometime and read it. It reminds me of phillip k. dick a little. Mostly because it is a science fiction but at the same time it is also more about enders feeling s and perceptions.</p>
<p>thats all for now</p>
