<p>So this last week was crazy. I did some balloon work for a cult. The  cult was the <a href="http://www.redhatsociety.com/">Red HAt Society</a>, which consists mostly of ladies over 50, if you happen to be under 50 you are instead a Pink Hat. I enjoyed it quite a bit and thank them for their genorosity and also would like to thank my mom for joining the aforementioned cult and hooking me up with the work. </p>
<p>I would say that as far as cults go this one is fairly layed back and is really more of a gang since religious beliefs didn't seem to be a big part of the proceedings.  So all you other hat societys watch out cause the red hats are gonna get you.</p>
<p>Oh and none of them really knew anything about Linux.. weird</p>
