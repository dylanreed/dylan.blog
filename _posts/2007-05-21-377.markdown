[![][1]][2]This is the[ car][2] that I want to get. It is a smart car and they are coming to America in 2008. Awesome! I figure that one of these cost as much as a nice motorcycle and would be more comfprtable to travel in. So Sarah and I can just get one of these. I also think that as a clown it would be the ultimate vehicle. I know just need to make enough money clowning to justify getting one of these.

These cars are only 8 feet long and 5 foot wide and tall. They have a top speed of 90mph and get around 40 mpg. Because of their size you can fit two smart cars in one parking spot, or Sarah and I could fit two inside our one car garage.

Awesome
