<p>I recently traded in a couple games and old systems to get Forza 2 for the XBOX 360. All and all I have been very happy with the game and enjoy racing and designing paint schemes for cars. One of the reasons I was very excited about this game was the fact that they had online auctions that you can sell your designs to other gamers.</p>
<p>Now normally when this sort of online capabilities is in an XBOX 360 game you are expected to be a Xbox live gold member. However one of the people who works at Turn 10 (the developer) stated in the <a href="http://forums.forzamotorsport.net/forums/thread/178178.aspx">forums</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>chespace:</strong></p>
<p>You can still bid and sell on the auction house with a silver account.<br />
You just can't do any real racing.</blockquote><br />
I took this to mean that I could do the auctions and what not without shelling out an additional $50 for a Gold Membership. I got the game on Friday, thanks Bob, and I played it all weekend, ask Sarah I mean all weekend. Then yesterday I had just finished a paint job that I was quite happy with and I went to put it in the Auction house and bam ,denied.</p>

<p>So like any nerd I went to the forums, turns out it was randomly decided to discontinue this service to silver members. This means that Turn Ten are a bunch of Poopie Pants Stupid Heads.......and also liars.</p>
