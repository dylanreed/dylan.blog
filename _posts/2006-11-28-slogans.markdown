<p>So lately I have been playing on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.threadless.com&#47;profile&#47;174696&#47;reallyreallyawesomeguy">threadless<&#47;a> site. Since I have no artistic ability I have been trying to come up with slogans for people to score it is a lot of fun. What makes me laugh is some of the random crap that comes out in those slogans. At times it seems to be like a forum with people flaming other designs by changing a few words. The only problem is that the voting interface isn't as cool as the graphic design scoring set up. Also I feel that more of the slogan people are like me, Really bored, without artistic talent. Its rough</p>
