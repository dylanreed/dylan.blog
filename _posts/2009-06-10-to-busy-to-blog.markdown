I have reached he point in the year where I am to busy to blog. I keep trying to write up a blog about our trip or what is going on in my life and I just can't make time. Sorry. Hopefully everything will get easier in the next couple weeks but I doubt it. I will attempt to do at least one update a week and see where it goes from there. 

Stupid life being busy.
