<h1>Back to Blogging</h1>
<h2>Maybe?</h2>
I have been busy writing and rewriting, so blogging has taken a backseat. I want to blog more but if I am going to let one form of writing slip it will be blogging. Fiction writing is much more personally rewarding and I enjoy doing it so much that it is hard for me to justify writing random thoughts down when I can instead move a story along. 

You may remember my NaNoWriMo triumph. I was excited because I had written my first novel. I was pleased with it, I let people read it and received positive feedback. Going through what I had written, I removed some things, but otherwise left the manuscript unchanged. 
Thanks to Harper, I was able to get in contact with a couple authors as well as an agent. Through these connections I learned a very important lesson. Writing is easy, rewriting is hard. 

I had been planning on releasing <i>Calliope and the Rogue Biologic</i> for the Kindle on April 1st. After my discussions I decided that rushing the release would kill the book and I didn’t want to do that. So I shifted focus. 

I read Calliope again. And made lots of notes. I studied story structure and plotting. I outlined my entire novel and laid it out in scrivener. I then went through my original manuscript and found where I could plug in the scenes that I loved. 

Camp NaNoWriMo happened in April and that is when I decided to rock out my rewrites. The concrete goal of finishing by the end of April help motivate me and was a positive step forward. 

And guess what? My story is better. I found an editor who I am actually paying to edit my manuscript to make it as perfect as possible (and you can help <a href="http://dylan.la/1VKl5gF">pay</a> for it). I now spend my time waiting on the edits to comeback and am reading a lot of new books. 

Part of my writing practice has been <a href=“http://acmeheroinc.com”>The Correspondent</a>. This project started out years ago when I wanted to write a superhero story. I had almost an entire notebook full of ideas of what I wanted to happen but felt that I would never complete such a large project. 
I even attempted to do it a while ago and failed. 

This attempt has gone a lot better. I built up a buffer of posts and set them to auto-publish. Once I finished the first arc I edited it and have put it on <a href=""http://dylan.la/1SaT8L4>Amazon</a> so you can read the whole Origin on your kindle. 

Reading the early posts vs. the more current ones is interesting because my writing ability has grown. 

In fact, I should be writing the next episode of The Correspondent right not… But I am suffering from a little bit of fiction burnout. I pushed so hard finishing the rewrites that I am now unable to think in terms of story. It is pretty sad. 
Here is hoping that I start blogging more often and with more interesting things. 

Thanks for reading.
