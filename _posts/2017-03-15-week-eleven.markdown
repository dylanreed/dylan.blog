Everything is looking up. I have been bullet journaling for about six months or so. I stumbled upon it when I was binge watching the [HowtoADHD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZGkcgy_95Q) (or as I read it: How Toad HD) and she did a great video on the benefits of the [BuJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hLnY9L1c-M). 

My first couple months were garbage. Like most of my efforts to have a day planner this one was ignored and forgotten. But I kept going back. At the most basic level the BuJo is great because nothing about it is set in stone. 

Now I have created a weekly spread that fits what I need it to, added goal and habit trackers, and I use it almost daily. Since I keep adding new things to my life it is nice to have a way to track them. 

The hardest thing, for me, about bullet journals is looking at all the cool things people do with them. They paint them, color them, basically make them little works of art. I will probably never get there, but mine does have pictures of Ramona in them... so I got that going for me. 

Now I just need to keep focused on my goals and reach them. I should also stop adding things to my plate, but that isn't going to happen. 

Have a great week!!
