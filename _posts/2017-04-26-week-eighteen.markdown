The week that has been. 

This week has been full of amazing, frustrating and crazy things. I am attempting to not count my chickens before they hatch so I will be keeping my cards close to my chest. BAM!! Double metaphor bonus points.

I did start reading the second book in the Kingkiller Chronicles. And it does not disappoint. It builds off of the first one nicely and adds so much more. And I am only 1/4 of the way through it. 

Ukulele is going well. I had a little drop off the previous week with some of the aforementioned frustrating things, but I am back on track to practicing everyday. 

For my birthday, my brother in law got me the Age of Sigmar. If you don't know about Warhammer, maybe don't go looking. The basics are that you assemble and paint miniatures and then set up epic battle. As nerdy things go it is pretty nerdy. And I am so excited.

Writing is back on track. I bought myself some blind boxes to use as rewards and that helps me stay motivated for the stuff I don't like to do. I have found more problems with Calliope and the Living Biologic that I need to address. The first read/edit of Rio Borealis is going well. 

That is pretty much it for this week.
