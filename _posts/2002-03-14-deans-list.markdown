Hey everyone

I made the deans list I got a 94 on my final in rigging giving my a 98 overall. this keeps me at a 4.0 and on the deans list again. its sweet. Sarah my girlfriend is coming to visit on sun. I am so excited I get to see her for a whole week. I also start charts and treatments on tues. that is supposedly the hardest class in my school. i plan on getting at least a 98 in that class. I should start welding classes soon. probably on tues and thurs evening. so then my tues and thurs will go from 8:00 until 10 at night, fun.Please send me emails at dylan@dylanreed.org. thanks. hope everyone is good.
