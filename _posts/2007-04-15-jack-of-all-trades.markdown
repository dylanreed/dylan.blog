<p>I have found that I am really just ok at a lot of skills. This has worked to my advantage in a lot of areas in my life and hasn't been very detrimental to my life. I think that what I need is the ability to apply my knowledge in a way that will get me a degree that I can apply to my real life. Here is a breakdown of my skills:</p>
<p>Html: I have a very, VERY basic knowledge of html, CSS and PHP. I find that this allows me to do various things around the Internet and prevents me from using programs such as FrontPage to create bad websites. I also find that this knowledge causes me to want to learn more so that I can do more and have to ask <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nata2.org">Harper<&#47;a> for help less often.</p>
<p>Sewing: I am able to sew pretty well, it basically comes down to being able to follow directions and problem solve the parts of the pattern I might not know how to do. I sometimes blunder and have to remove stitches and sew the seam again, but for the most part I am able to get my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;imadeit.myshopify.com">purses<&#47;a> made.</p>
<p>Entertainment: This is a whole subset of my life and I unfortunately am not the master of any of the specific skills involved. Part of this comes from the fact that I just jumped into entertaining and didn't have an effective method of training myself. It dosen't matter if it is card tricks or juggling or unicycling, I need much more practice then I bother to do and while I am able to get by as an entertainer I find that while I am watching other entertainers I feel strangely inadequate.</p>
<p>Diving: I went to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.natpoly.edu&#47;">commercial diving sch<&#47;a>ool so I have quite a bit of book knowledge about the ins and outs of diving, however, I dive infrequently and haven't taken my recreational diving skills very far. I basically just like to be underwater and feel confident that I am able to plan for any emergency underwater by planning.</p>
<p>Welding: I enjoy welding and do ok at it but I know that none of my welds would pass any weld test. I defiantly blew a great learning opportunity while at dive school by not pursuing welding like I should have. I could probably with a little more practice get my 2G certification, but since most of the welding I do is very basic and dosen't need to hold up by any standards, I don't worry about it.</p>
<p>Dance: I have taken about 5 years of ballet and jazz classes. While I think that this has improved my ability to move while entertaining I am under no illusions that I am a great dancer. I am just lucky that I have good muscle memory so I am able to do ok at ballet. Oh and I like to jump.</p>
<p>Gymnastics: I took a lot of tumbling classes while I was in high school and continued for a couple of years out of high school. I found tumbling to by easy for me since I had no fear. I was working on double front and back flips when I hurt myself. That ruined gymnastics for me since I know had fear, though I think that I would like to go back and get back in tumbling shape.</p>
<p>I know that there are other things that I can do,  I just can't remember them right now. I think that I enjoy be a Jack of all trades and a master of none. It allows me to act in any situation and allows me to solve problems quickly and creatively. I always tell my self that I am going to focus on one area and learn more and get a broader knowledge of a subject, but deep down inside I know that I will probably just continue to grow all of my skills slowly but all at the same time.</p>
