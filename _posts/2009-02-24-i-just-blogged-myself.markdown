I have a lot of friends that blog. I have noticed that, like me, most non-professional bloggers have dry-spells. An example of this is the two or three times I have blogged less then five times in a year. Whenever I find myself having a blogging dry-spell it is because I convince myself that I don't have time. I have never had a dry-spell because I didn't have anything to say.

The hardest part about being a consistent blogger is setting aside time to write. As you may have noticed this blog has had a sudden upswing in the number and frequency of posts. "Why is this?" you ask. It is because I have finally set aside time to write and I carry writing stuff with me where ever I go. Since I write everyday Monday through Friday it is really easy for me to find things to add to the blog and I have become more comfortable writing about a variety of subjects.

What this has caused is a smorgasbord of daily posts about a variety of things. From SCUBA diving to Unicycles all the way to Video Games. This blog now has it all. Since I spend a large part of my day not at a computer or when I am at a computer I am not allowed to post blogs I have started writing in journals. This has been a wonderful development in two ways: Having writing equipment with me everywhere I go allows me to write things that otherwise would have been forgotten in the depths of my brain and the quality of my posts has gotten better since I can proofread as I type.

I suggest every blogger give this a try. It will increase the number of blogs you post and also provide you with a great way to connect with your friends and family. Here is a list of people that I wish would do this

  * [Sarah][1]
  * [Harper][2]
  * [This Jon][3]
  * [That Jon][4]
