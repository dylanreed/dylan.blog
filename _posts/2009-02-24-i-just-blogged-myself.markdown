<p>I have a lot of friends that blog. I have noticed that, like me, most non-professional bloggers have dry-spells. An example of this is the two or three times I have blogged less then five times in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">year<&#47;span>. Whenever I find myself having a blogging dry-spell it is because I convince myself that I don't have time. I have never had a dry-spell because I didn't have anything to say.</p>
<p>The hardest part about being a consistent blogger is setting aside time to write. As you may have noticed this blog has had a sudden upswing in the number and frequency of posts. "Why is this?" you ask. It is because I have finally set aside time to write and I carry writing stuff with me where ever I go. Since I write everyday Monday through Friday it is really easy for me to find things to add to the blog and I have become more comfortable writing about a variety of subjects.</p>
<p>What this has caused is a smorgasbord of daily posts about a variety of things. From SCUBA diving to Unicycles all the way to Video Games. This blog now has it all. Since I spend a large part of my day not at a computer or when I am at a computer I am not allowed to post blogs I have started writing in journals. This has been a wonderful development in two ways: Having writing equipment with me everywhere I go allows me to write things that otherwise would have been forgotten in the depths of my brain and the quality of my posts has gotten better since I can proofread as I type.</p>
<p>I suggest every blogger give this a try. It will increase the number of blogs you post and also provide you with a great way to connect with your friends and family. Here is a list of people that I wish would do this</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;photodork.org">Sarah<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;nata2.org">Harper<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.in5anity.org&#47;">This Jon<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.myspace.com&#47;index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&amp;friendID=306504962">That Jon<&#47;a><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Here is the list of people I want to have Blogs</p>
<ul>
<li>Mom<&#47;li>
<li>Dad<&#47;li>
<li>Liz Graham<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
If you are in the above lists, start writing more. If you don't have a blog, let me know and I will help you get one.</p>
