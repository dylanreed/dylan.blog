<p>Jon and I finished Halo 3 on Monday night. Overall I enjoyed the game, though I felt that it was really short since Bungie spent most of their time working on the multi player.</p>
<p>Bungie, as usual, did a good job of keep up the frantic pace of 30 second battles every minute or so. This leads to a lot of high stress moments of getting owned by aliens with the final satisfaction of killing all of the bad guys.</p>
<p>On thing that I thought was interesting was how they gave the covenant a huge scarab tank, which could destroy just about everything and was quite a pain in the ass to kill. The first time we encountered it Jon and I got killed pretty quick and had to resort to one of us pounding it with a tank while the other one ran around waiting for it to fall so it could be killed from the inside.</p>
<p>The last time we encountered the big tanks the game was nice enough to give us aircraft to attack with. I flew Jon over the tanks and and he dropped off and blew the tanks up from the inside. It was quite fun.</p>
<p>I was disappointed in the last level as it was to much running and not enough gunning.</p><embed name="VE_Player" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" align="middle" src="http://update.videoegg.com/flash/proxy.swf?jsver=1.4" width="300" height="249" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashvars="gc=c2hvd0FkPXRydWUmYWRWYXJzPWFyZWE9Z2FtZXMmc2l0ZT1lc2NhcGlzdG1hZ2F6aW5lJmZpbGU9aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRnNlbGZzZXJ2ZTMwMCUyRWRvd25sb2FkJTJFdmlkZW9lZ2clMkVjb20lMkZnaWQzODklMkZjaWQxMzg5JTJGSTUlMkZHUSUyRjExOTEyNzM3MTFuSEk4SEZNSWlmM3ZxV1R3YWtMSyZzd2ZwYXRoPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZ1cGRhdGUlMkV2aWRlb2VnZyUyRWNvbSUyRmZsYXNoJTJGcHJveHklMkVzd2YlM0Zqc3ZlciUzRDElMkU0JmF1dG9QbGF5PWZhbHNlJnNob3dBZFByaW1hcnk9dHJ1ZSZ3bW9kZT13aW5kb3cmYWxsb3dGbGFzaDlGdWxsc2NyZWVuPXRydWU=" quality="high" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" scale="noscale" wmode="window"></embed></p>
