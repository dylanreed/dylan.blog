Today I canceled our Direct TV service. Not because we where unhappy with it, just because we wanted to save money. So I end up talking to their cancellation specialist and he tried very hard to convince me that I can afford direct TV. The first option was lowering the price by $10 a month for a year. Which I though was a very nice offer. I politely declined and he then said that we could get 45 channels for only $29.99 a month. I was intrigued but stayed strong and succeeded in canceling the service.

Once all that was done I asked him what I needed to do with the little black box. He put me on hold to look into it and eventually came back and told me I needed to return it to T-Bone Ranch. T-Bone Ranch just happens to be a sub-division in Greeley and it happens to be the sub-division in which our condo is located. I pointed this out to the man and he was quite confused. He told me that I needed to turn it into whoever I got it from, when I told him that I didn't know the name of the company that I got it from  and that I didn't have a bill from them with a phone number, he got real confused and had to put me on hold. 

When he got back on he told me that I could keep the box and that I didn't need to worry about it. So confusing.
