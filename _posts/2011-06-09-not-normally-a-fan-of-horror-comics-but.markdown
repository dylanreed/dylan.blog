But Echos has been a lot of fun. I just finished number one this morning and am excited to start number two.  


  


I should probably post a little more about this. I didn't at first because I didn't think that the widget had worked... well if did so here is a little more of what I liked about this comic. First: it isn't BOO!!!! scary comic, at least not yet. Secondly: it has a wonderful lack of color that give it a much more dreary and closed in feel. Thirdly: I like the overall story and use of the medium of comics to tell that story. 

Check it out
