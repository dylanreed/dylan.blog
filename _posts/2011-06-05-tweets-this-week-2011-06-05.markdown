  * Waffles, sewing, hanging out with cats and wife outside and comic books. What a great day!! [#][1]
  * I did not realize Fraggle Rock had a comic @[graphicly][2] [http://t.co/RtCzyCM][3] [#][4]
  * turntable.fm is quite a bit of fun [#][5]
  * I hate it when sarah isn't around. I can't sleep and I have a crazy day in the morning. [#][6]
  * time for some lunch of the lunch meeting variety [#][7]
  * I am bad at recovering from being out late. So sleepy. Looks like it is time to watch the xmen movies and nap. [#][8]
