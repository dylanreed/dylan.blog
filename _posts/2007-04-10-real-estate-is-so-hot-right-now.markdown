I was cruising the internet and came across [this][1] article about a guy who has claimed ownership of the moon and all of the planets. This wasn't the first I had heard about this however. A couple of years ago my smart ass [brother][2] and his friends read about this guy and so they staked a claim on the [sun][3]. They are now the owners of the ultimate energy source in the solar system and are selling stakes in that energy source.

So buy some today and support a worthy cause, don't by land on planets from some greedy bastard, buy energy from a bunch of nerds.
