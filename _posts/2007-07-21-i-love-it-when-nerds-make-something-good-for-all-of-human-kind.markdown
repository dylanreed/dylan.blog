<p>There are a lot of sites and services that serve no real purpose to the world. They are sites that lead to a lot of time wasting and a general sense of eh. I am&nbsp;of course talking about online <a href="http://weewar.com/">games</a> and places that let you create things you can't&nbsp;<a href="http://miniusa.com/">afford</a> <a href="http://www.dell.com/">online</a> so you can dream of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!--adsense#refer--></p>
<p>But every now and then a site comes a long that helps you get things done and does it in a fun and exciting way. I am of course talking about <a href="http://www.chorewars.com/">ChoreWars</a>. I stumbled uponm this and think that it is something that Sarah and I could actually use. And by Sarah and I, I mean Sarah using it to motivate me to do house work. </p>

<p>For some reason gaining XP for doing normal everyday household activities make me happy. Soon I will be a level 9 tub scrubber or something. It will be so awesome.</p>
