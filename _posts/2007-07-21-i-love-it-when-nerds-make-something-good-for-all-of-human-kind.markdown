<p>There are a lot of sites and services that serve no real purpose to the world. They are sites that lead to a lot of time wasting and a general sense of eh. I am&nbsp;of course talking about online <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weewar.com&#47;">games<&#47;a> and places that let you create things you can't&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;miniusa.com&#47;">afford<&#47;a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dell.com&#47;">online<&#47;a> so you can dream of them.&nbsp;<&#47;p>

<p>But every now and then a site comes a long that helps you get things done and does it in a fun and exciting way. I am of course talking about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.chorewars.com&#47;">ChoreWars<&#47;a>. I stumbled uponm this and think that it is something that Sarah and I could actually use. And by Sarah and I, I mean Sarah using it to motivate me to do house work. <&#47;p>

<p>For some reason gaining XP for doing normal everyday household activities make me happy. Soon I will be a level 9 tub scrubber or something. It will be so awesome.<&#47;p>
