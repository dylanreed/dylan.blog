<p>I recently ordered Sarah a new phone from <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/splash/splash.jsp?vendorid=PERFORMICS&jspName=/splash/splash.jsp&v=16&cm_ven=Performics&cm_cat=Affiliate&cm_pla=234x60_equip_2.gif&cm_ite=Bluemark%20Worldwide%2C%20LLC&cm_ite=perform2006">Verizon Wireless</a> and overall it was a great experience. What I found frustrating was the in window chat. My first experience with it was quite good, they where able to help me select a phone and it expedited the process considerably. My only complaint was that they don't seem to have the ability to send links to x model of phone over the chat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I had to switch computers before I could finish the transaction so I had to start all over at the beginning. I found the phone selected the plan entered all the porting information and was entering my credit card information when the chat window appeared: "Do you need help selecting a phone?" What? I am about to give you money and you are going to confuse me with un needed help. I think that they need to rethink this and make it so that once you reach a certain point you are not bothered by the often robotic chat helpers.</p>
