I recently ordered Sarah a new phone from [Verizon Wireless][1] and overall it was a great experience. What I found frustrating was the in window chat. My first experience with it was quite good, they where able to help me select a phone and it expedited the process considerably. My only complaint was that they don't seem to have the ability to send links to x model of phone over the chat.

Unfortunately I had to switch computers before I could finish the transaction so I had to start all over at the beginning. I found the phone selected the plan entered all the porting information and was entering my credit card information when the chat window appeared: "Do you need help selecting a phone?" What? I am about to give you money and you are going to confuse me with un needed help. I think that they need to rethink this and make it so that once you reach a certain point you are not bothered by the often robotic chat helpers.
