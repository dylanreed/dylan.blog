I have found that by giving myself a writing deadline I write more blog posts. I am trying to update [The Usable Clown][1] on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and so far so good. I am a little blocked up for MondayÃ¢a‚¬a„¢s post but the night is young, I am sure I wil think of something. The problem is that I have a bunch of posts, that link to a post I am posting on this Friday, planned but I havenÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t wrote them yet.

I am hoping that by updating dylanreed.org, I will come up with an idea that will be magical. Here is to hoping.

If you feel like going and visiting, check out my new site, [The Usable Clown][2]. The site consists of post on my feelings on what clowns need to do to have a successful business as well as letting me write a bunch of articles on clowning that I have felt the need to write but didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t have an outlet.

Another thing I am try to do is to write these in a way that makes them more pleasant to read. I have also been trying to write better headlines to my posts so people want to read them.

The really interesting thing is that I have been writing all of my post by hand in the real world before sitting down and typing them. I find that this forces me to proof read as I am typing as well as being appalled by my hand writing.

Also starting this week I am starting to take Omega-3 Fatty Acids for ADHD. My mom read somewhere that it will help so it is guinea pig time. I will keep you posted on the results so all you ADHD freaks can reap the benefits of the experiment.
