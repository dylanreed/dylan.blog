<p>I have found that by giving myself a writing deadline I write more blog posts. I am trying to update <a href="http://www.clownusability.com">The Usable Clown</a> on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and so far so good. I am a little blocked up for Monday&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;s post but the night is young, I am sure I wil think of something. The problem is that I have a bunch of posts, that link to a post I am posting on this Friday, planned but I haven&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;t wrote them yet.</p>
<p>I am hoping that by updating dylanreed.org, I will come up with an idea that will be magical. Here is to hoping.</p>
<p>If you feel like going and visiting, check out my new site, <a href="http://www.clownusability.com">The Usable Clown</a>. The site consists of post on my feelings on what clowns need to do to have a successful business as well as letting me write a bunch of articles on clowning that I have felt the need to write but didn&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;t have an outlet.</p>
<p>Another thing I am try to do is to write these in a way that makes them more pleasant to read. I have also been trying to write better headlines to my posts so people want to read them.</p>
<p>The really interesting thing is that I have been writing all of my post by hand in the real world before sitting down and typing them. I find that this forces me to proof read as I am typing as well as being appalled by my hand writing.</p>
<p>Also starting this week I am starting to take Omega-3 Fatty Acids for ADHD. My mom read somewhere that it will help so it is guinea pig time. I will keep you posted on the results so all you ADHD freaks can reap the benefits of the experiment.</p>
