<p>So I got a Dell Optiplex for work. It is great I just finished putting music on it and am listening to Tubular Bells. The best thing that about my new computer is the 19" monitor. I am going to be sad to have to go home and use that computer with its small (15" i think) monitor. Sarah and I have a plan. No news for you folks just know that New Stuff is going to be happening soon.</p>
<p>There has been a release of stuff that I want, a lot of stuff I want. First it was these <a title="Cards" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ellusionist.com&#47;order&#47;Bicycle-Masters-Edition-Playing-Cards.php?cat={CATEGORY%20ID}">cards<&#47;a>. These cards are great because they are the same as regular bicycles except they are printed on a nicer stock of paper. This allows a greater life to the cards as well as a smoother operation. Also since these cards where made by magicians quickly to follow will be a gaff deck that allows for awesome tricks.</p>
<p>The other awesome thing is also from the magic world. It is a trick called Silver Dream. It is a great coin trick that has the greatest handling I have seen. Basically you make three coins disappear and reappear and then disappear. Check it out <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ellusionist.com&#47;order&#47;Silver-Dream-Justin-Miller.php">here.<&#47;a> To do this trick all you need is three same coins and maybe sleeves but what do I know. In the preview video he (Justin&Atilde;&macr;&Acirc;&iquest;&Acirc;&frac12; Miller) uses a prduct called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ellusionist.com&#47;order&#47;UltraSmoke-2000.htm?cat=137">Ultra Smoke<&#47;a> to create smoke when he disappears the second coin.</p>
<p>Another neat project is made more for adding a "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ellusionist.com&#47;order&#47;Yigal-Mesika-Presents-The-Electric-Touch.php">Shocking<&#47;a>" bit of magic to your mind reading it is an apparatus that allows you to shock the living daylights out of people. And if it dosen't allow that it should.</p>
<p>Now all i need is money to buy these things.</p>
