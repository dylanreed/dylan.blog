<p>and fun. So <a href="http:&#47;&#47;xbox360.gamespy.com&#47;xbox-360&#47;assassins-creed&#47;834669p1.html" target="_blank">many<&#47;a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;xbox360.ign.com&#47;articles&#47;834&#47;834676p1.html" target="_blank">people<&#47;a> said so many hateful things about this game:<&#47;p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>There really isn't another game quite like it. Unfortunately, there isn't another game with issues quite like Creed's, either. Assassin's Creed tries to be a stealth game, an action game, a stealth kill game and a platformer, and to innovate in each category. But for each amazing step forward, Creed takes a half-step back.<&#47;em><&#47;p><&#47;blockquote>
<p>or<&#47;p><br />
<blockquote>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed<&#47;em><em> could easily have been one of the best games of 2007. It is, without question, impressive on several fronts. But developer Ubisoft Montreal took some missteps along the way and squandered the immense potential of its pseudo-stealth action title. A bad story, repetitive gameplay elements, and poor AI lead to the downfall of one of the more promising games in recent memory. Assassin's Creed could have been one of the great games of this generation. Instead, it turned into just another action title.<&#47;em><&#47;p><&#47;blockquote>
<p>This makes me sad and a little disappointed. Granted I have only played the game for about 30 minutes, but what I have played is quite enjoyable. I of course haven't encountered any of the repetitive gameplay elements that IGN was so upset about, but what game dosen't have any repetitive game elements. Pretty much every game that I have played has some repetitive game elements. Even the awesome classic games, such as Super Mario World, have an incredible number of tasks that you do over and over and over again. I am looking at you Reznor dinosaurs. <&#47;p>
<p>One nice thing is that a different website, which is a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.penny-arcade.com&#47;2007&#47;11&#47;14" target="_blank">gaming<&#47;a> based web comic, had an interesting take on the whole situation. Basically they said that the reviewers where forcing their way through the game and not taking the time to enjoy the game. That is the flaw with game reviewing as a job. You have to many game piled up to really enjoy the games that you are playing. <&#47;p>
<p>I don't know if Assassins Creed will be the best game that I will play this year, but it will probably be up there. Any game that lets me sneak around, climb buildings and throw people off them or stab them with some pretty blood splatter is alright with me. Plus the story is pretty fun. Its a fantasy type game with a sci-fi twist. I agree with some of the reviewers that said that the main twist of the game was given away in the first 10 seconds of the game. However that dosen't stop me from loving the rest of the game. <&#47;p></p>
