<p>I went to Target to pick up Sarah's prescriptions and whilst I was waiting a came across the Nintendo 3DS. I played Pilotwings on the demo machine and all I could think of, aside from how much fun it was, was all the times Harper and I would go to Target with my mom and play tetris on the demo machine of the original Gameboy. These same visits would enevitably end with my mom having to page us over the PA system, which pissed her off, and we would hurry to the front of the store.</p>
<p>What I really enjoyed was that unlike a lot of demos that I have seen of handheld machines this one actually let you hold the system in your hands... crazy right. I also liked the feel of the machine. The current DS lite that I am playing on has very little weight to it, especially when compared to the 3DS.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that I would love to have one. I am actually excited about a couple launch titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilotwings Resort</li>
<li>Steel Diver</li>
<li>Super Monkey Ball</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda:&nbsp;Ocarina of Time</li>
<li>Star Fox 64</li>
<li>Resident Evil: Mercenaries</li><br />
</ul><br />
What I think is funny is that a lot of these games are remakes of games Nintendo has released numerous times, I am actually surprised at the number that I want to play. I am also surprised that there isn't a Mario title included in the launch, though the inclusion of everyone's favorite Zelda game was a good plan on Nintendo's part.</p>
