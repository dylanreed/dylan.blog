  content: "First off - my wife and I took the handmade pledge months ago.  We travel
    around like Carnies selling her handmade goods at places like Renegade Chicago
    next month.  Glad to see a fellow Creator of Things!\r\n\r\nSecondly, I am the
    voice of @atmosenergy on Twitter. I was sorry to see you were recently disappointed
    with our service.  We actually work very hard to provide our customers with the
    highest level of service possible.  Email me at the address I have provided if
    I can help in any way.\r\n\r\nBest of luck to you, \r\n\r\njd"
