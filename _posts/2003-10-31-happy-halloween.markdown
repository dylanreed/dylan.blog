<p>So today i was driving to school and i passed a hitchhiker and I thoght. gee its cold and snowy no one needs to walk on halloween day. so i stopped to pick him up and damn it if there wasn't a cop behind me and he pulled over two. just when we had both stopped the hitcher pulled out a gun and shot the cop in the face. WTF so he forced me into my car and told me to drive. </p>
<p>right that happened.</p>
<p>happy halloween</p>
