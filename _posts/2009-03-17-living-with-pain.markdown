  content: I am glad you liked it. I am sorry to hear that your pain is brain pain.
    I, luckily, just have a lot of ankle,knee and elbow pain so I can't begin to understand
    what brain pain is like.

<p>Chronic pain is a part of a lot of people's lives, <a href="http://www.dylanreed.com/category/injuries/">mine included</a>. The worst part of chronic pain is that you know you can't do anything about it, there are rarely any drugs that help with it, and you feel like you are the only one who is experiencing that type of pain. What I have noticed a lot of people doing is misinterpreting how they have to treat their pain.</p>
<p>Think of your pain as a roommate. You are living with it. You have to share a lot of your life with the pain, you may even have to change the way you live because of it but it doesn't change who you are at your core. If you are living with someone and they are annoying, you learn to deal with it, you may get mad or you may just ignore it, but you live with it. Pain is the same way.</p>
<p>You can live with any pain as long as you focus on the positive. The most common positive is that you are not dead. Sure it hurts like hell but at least you have the rest of your life to live. The last part is important, you have to <strong>LIVE</strong>. The more you let your pain control your life the more you start falling into the other category of dealing with chronic pain and that is no good.</p>
<p>You don't want to live in pain. Living in pain is when you let your pain control your life. This is just like when you have to live somewhere that you don't want. Like Nebraska. No one wants to live in Nebraska, if someone says they do they are lying. If you find yourself altering major parts of your life because of your pain you are living in pain. Stop. Think about little things you can do to adjust your life.</p>
<p>Simple things can be done to make your pain more manageable while allowing you to continue to do the things that you love. Maybe going to a Yoga class or a Sit and Be Fit class will allow you to move better. Getting yourself more mobile will help you do any activities that you miss doing or you have stopped doing. Please if you are living in pain, try switching. Living with pain is so much better.</p>
