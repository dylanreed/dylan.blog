<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thestar.com&#47;News&#47;article&#47;198600">WTF.<&#47;a>&nbsp;So I thought the second one of my first post of the day was bad. I mean exposing yourself over the Internet and getting a way with is pretty bad. However this one is much funnier and also&nbsp;much more of a WTF. So you got mad at a kid, don't throw poop, that is just bad form.<&#47;p>
<p>&nbsp;<&#47;p>
<p>I am still laughing.<&#47;p></p>
