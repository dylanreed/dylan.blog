<p>I have been stuck in a little bit of a reading rut. I read the same books over and over again. On the plus side I really enjoy the books I read, on the minus side is the fact that I rarely experience the joy of surprise that comes from reading a new book.</p>
<p>In high school my future brother-in-law went to all the teachers he respected and asked them for a list of books that he should read. I don't remember how long it was but he committed himself to making his way through it. Seems like a pretty fantastic plan.</p>
<p>I have set up a form via google for people to submit books to. It is <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/dylanreed.com/forms/d/19iC8VVfX7-5RHDIa3D-pL7mAiU0eFD_6eQW7HtTsd9w/viewform">here</a>. Please take the time to suggest one or more books. I will also make the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjuRpKKTHJltdEp2WDJSN0hmYWlaeXRSOFRzbWk1T1E&amp;usp=sharing">list</a> view able so that you can check if the book you are suggesting is one that has been suggested.</p>
<p>Please suggest books. I will be compiling a list by the first-ish of the year and try to read as many books as possible in 2014. I have to finish reading the Harry Potter series for the thousandth time first so you have books 4, 5,6 and 7 to suggest books.&nbsp;After I get some books I am going to try to create a random chooser to help me make the list.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.65;">Thanks&nbsp;</span></p>
