<p>I know that a lot of people have posted about how they make millions of dollars just by blogging. I am happy to report that adsense has made me 10's of dollars. Yep I have made 10 10's of dollars. Thats right after almost 28 months I finally broke the $100 first payment mark.</p>
<p>At this rate I will make $1000 in 23 years. Beat that all you rich Internet kids, 23 years. Here are the five simple steps you can follow so you to can buy $100 worth of crap just by blogging for two years and four months.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a blog: Duh, this is the easiest step. Find one of the free sites that give out blogs and sign up. Or as I did, have a computer nerd brother that wants you to blog set one up for you and host it.<&#47;li>
<li>Start off strong: Post a lot, and about really mundane crap. This way anyone who wonders to your site will be bored and your three readers will be your mom, brother and fiance.<&#47;li>
<li>Get adsense: Sign up, get invited whatever, just get it. Wait about another month and finally implement the code on your site<&#47;li>
<li>The system: Figure out that what you write about affects who visits your site and what kind of ads you get. Try to write about things you know and are worth a lot of money to advertise. Don't ask me what those are, I don't know either.<&#47;li>
<li>Profit: Keep track of your adsense until you are rich(er) then you where before all of this started.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br />
<!--adsense--></p>
<p>Remember this take patients and a lot of sacrifice. Well actually very little sacrifice, unless you count the time I could have been spending playing video games.</p>
