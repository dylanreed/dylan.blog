<p>This morning, May 20th, I made Sarah and I homemade donuts with her donut pan she got for her birthday. We enjoyed them quite a bit and I shared one with my mom and one with my friend Jon. I forgot to take one over to my mother in law like I was supposed to. Luckily we had two left over that I ran over tonight with this card attached. Feel free to use it whenever you forget to give someone homemade donuts. <a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4626047702_abff404fba.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Well Crap" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4626047702_abff404fba.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="500" /></a>For those of you that are wondering they where delicious and they were&nbsp;cinnamon/sugar cake donuts. Sarah also got a mini donut pan which we will try out next.</p>
