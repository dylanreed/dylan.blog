<p class="MsoNormal">I was listening to NPR this morning and was very interested in the story about Vietnam banning dancing. I found the story to be fascinating because I take my right to dance very seriously. I was already wondering if whoever proposed the law had watched Footloose. Do they really want tractor-chicken to replace dancing in Karaoke bars? I also fail to see the connection between dancing, prostitution and drugs. I could connect two of the three pretty easy but all three is hard.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other then my appellation at the potential of dance banning I was disappointed in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.npr.org&#47;templates&#47;story&#47;story.php?storyId=103158512">NPR&rsquo;s<&#47;a>&nbsp;treatment of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.npr.org&#47;templates&#47;player&#47;mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=103158512&amp;m=103158494">story<&#47;a>. Making the connection to Footloose I can understand, because in the movie dancing was against the rules, however the forced connection to Seinfeld(2:10) was uncalled for.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I don&rsquo;t understand what that audio clip of a Seinfeld episode had to do with the story. Is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.npr.org&#47;templates&#47;story&#47;story.php?storyId=2101265">Michael Sullivan<&#47;a>&nbsp;just a huge Seinfeld fan or is it that he had no decent information and just kept adding the audio from different video clips to fill the time? I am not sure if he knows that when he played that clip from Seinfeld we couldn&rsquo;t see what was going on. <span>&nbsp;<&#47;span>Since I haven&rsquo;t seen this episode of the show I had no idea what was going on in that clip.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Come on NPR, I expect more from you.&nbsp;<&#47;p></p>
