<p>Today I stopped briefly at the Pottery Studio to visit Sarah, while I was there I got to see her vases that she has been working on for the past couple weeks. They look very nice but since they are not glazed yet they don't necessarily look pretty yet.<&#47;p>
<p>When I left the studio I skipped to my car. I personally enjoy skipping, since it is better then walking and easier then running, and I feel that more people should skip as they go about their business. Especially the people that looked at me like I was crazy as I skipped. I don't know if those people have skipped a day in their lives.<&#47;p></p>
