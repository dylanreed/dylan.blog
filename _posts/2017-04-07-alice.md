<h4>Synopsis</h4>

In a warren of crumbling buildings and desperate people called the Old City, there stands a hospital with cinderblock walls which echo the screams of the poor souls inside.

In the hospital, there is a woman. Her hair, once blond, hangs in tangles down her back. She doesn’t remember why she’s in such a terrible place. Just a tea party long ago, and long ears, and blood…

Then, one night, a fire at the hospital gives the woman a chance to escape, tumbling out of the hole that imprisoned her, leaving her free to uncover the truth about what happened to her all those years ago.

<h4>Review</h4>

This is not your standard Alice and Wonderland story. This [Alice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425266796/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dylanreed06-20) is a different beast altogether. At once scary and insane. 

The descriptions in this book leave little to the imagination. I was at once horrified and impressed. This book did a great job of creeping me out, it was a book that I couldn't read before bed. The couple times I did I had super weird and vivid dreams. 

I felt the same level of paranoia that Alice had during this entire book. Each of the well known characters from Alice in Wonderland exist in this book but in horribly demented ways.
