<h2>I AM OLD!!!</h2><br />
Look at that beard--></p>
<p>First off thanks to everyone that has wished me happy birthday today. You are all awesome. And to those of you who have read my blog since the beginning, you are also awesome. If you are one of the rare few that have done both, well played.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="342" caption="Happy Valentines Day"]<a href="http://fancycadaver.com/2011/02/14/happy-valentines-day/"><img class="  " title="Vday" src="http://fancycadaver.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/vdaycolor.jpg" alt="" width="342" height="456" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>I decided to do a valentines day drawing today, mostly to celebrate my 30th b-day by being a creepy old man and drawing a&nbsp;scantily&nbsp;clad teenage girl. Actually I thought that this would be funny because I rarely do anything for v-day because it is my birthday and I prefer to get presents rather then give them on my birthday, because I am selfish.</p>
<p>Since this is my 600th post, which is a lot of posts, I figure I should do some sort of retrospective... but I think I did that at 500 and there hasn't been that much new and exciting stuff that has happend on this blog since then. Enjoy your v-day with your loved ones, that is after all what it is for and make sure you eat a little bit of chocolate.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow... probably.</p>
