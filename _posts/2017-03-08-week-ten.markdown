Guess what the new hotness is? Ukulele!! I may have mentioned it before but I have recently started playing the ukulele. I started about three-ish weeks ago and it has been awesome. 

I feel like it is the new drug that I take for my ADHD. It is meditative and fun. It uses all parts of my brain and it pushes me creatively. The most hilarious part is how much I want to practice. 

Never before have I actually wanted to practice a musical instrument. Piano was fun, but I was so young and didn't understand how important practice was. Tuba was easy and didn't require a lot of practice, and I didn't really care. 

And then their was the accordion. I wanted to learn how to play the accordion to use as part of my clown show, but I didn't want to work at it. In fact I don't think that I ever really practiced. 

Needless to say, other than a few small songs that I can play from memory, I am unable to play anything on any of those instruments. 

The ukulele is different. I have read that a lot of guitar players consider the ukulele to be the clown of guitars... which is perfect for me. 

Since I first borrowed my mom's ukulele I have played for at least 30 minutes a day. Which, aside from my writing, is the most consistent I have been with a hobby. 

Speaking of writing: I have set up a pre-order for [Dragon Hoard](https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Hoard-Dylan-Reed-ebook/dp/B06XFF8X4X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1488944028&sr=8-2&keywords=dylan+reed) on amazon. Please go pre-order it and when you read it write a review. 

Don't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)
